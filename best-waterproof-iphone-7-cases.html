<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>The Best Waterproof iPhone 7 Cases</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The <a href=#>iPhone 7</a> is now a certified oldie but goodie. It also carries an IP67 rating, meaning it’s dustproof and water-resistant with the ability to survive in up to one meter of water for 30 minutes. But you may require more than that, as water-resistant does not equal waterproof. While there are a few cases out there that only match the iPhone 7’s IP67 rating, if you want better protection for your old standby, we suggest getting a waterproof case to harden your aging handset’s defenses against the elements.</p><h3>More iPhone 7 guides</h3><h2>SportLink Waterproof Case</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64><p>If you’re looking for rugged, full-body, heavy-duty protection from harsh environments — as well as an IP68 certified fully sealed waterproof case — look no further than the multi-functional SportLink Waterproof Case. Use this case at the beach or underwater for any activity or to capture images. In addition to being waterproof, the case is shockproof and dustproof. You can place your phone on a wireless charger without removing the case. It’s easy to install and supports your iPhone’s Touch ID, speaker, buttons, sensors, and cameras.</p><h2>CellEver Waterproof Case</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The CellEver Waterproof Case provides easy access to all the iPhone functions you need, like Touch ID, speaker, microphone, buttons, sensors, and front and rear cameras — all in an IP68-certified waterproof enclosure. Safe, protective, and light, the case is perfect for swimming, diving, and submerging up to 6.6 feet for an hour. It even has a wider charger port opening to fit larger 3rd party lightning cables.&nbsp;It’s also designed and tested to protect and withstand shocks and drops of up to 6.6 feet. The package includes a cleaning cloth and hand strap.</p><h2 id=title class="a-size-large a-spacing-none">LifeProof FRĒ Waterproof Case</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>This case is an updated version of the original LifeProof FRĒ Waterproof Case that’s compatible with the iPhone 7/8 and SE (2020). Its IP68 ingress protection rating makes it water- and snow-proof as well as fully submersible to 66.5 meters for one hour. It meets or exceeds the military MIL-STD 810F-516 drop standard. In addition to being sealed from snow, ice, dirt, and dust particles it also offers built-in scratch protection, full access to buttons and controls, and charge and sync via the USB port. It’s a bulky case with a built-in <a href=#>screen protector</a>&nbsp;and chunky button and port covers, but it provides easy access to all essential iPhone features.</p><h2>Dog & Bone Wetsuit Case</h2><h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64 data-dt-lazy-src="https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dog-bone-wetsuit-copy.jpg?fit=720%2C720&p=1" onerror=dti_load_error(this) decoding=async alt="Dog & Bone Wetsuit case." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></h2><p>The Dog & Bone Wetsuit — which combines silicone, polycarbonate, and rubber for a secure fit — is a tough iPhone case that offers IP68 protection and drop protection at up to 6.6 feet (2 meters). It provides a secure port cover, button covers, and accurate cutouts for the camera and Touch ID, but there’s no screen protector — this case forms a seal with the touchscreen instead. While the open screen ensures touch sensitivity, it does leave your screen exposed. The rubber bumper and textured back add extra grip.</p><h2>Catalyst Case</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>While the Catalyst case scores an IP68 rating, the company tests each unit to even greater depths and promises that its cases are waterproof up to 33 feet (10 meters). You also get good <a href=#>drop protection</a>&nbsp;for falls from up to 6.6 feet (2 meters). The soft rubber exterior is comfortable to hold and adds some grip, and there’s easy access to the Touch ID, buttons, and camera. A thin screen protector is built in, which doesn’t interfere with touch sensitivity, and a rotating crown dial operates the mute switch.</p><h2>Pelican Marine Case</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><a href=#>Pelican</a> offers an array of top-tier protective cases with stellar reputations as some of the best on the market. This Marine case for iPhone 7 not only prevents any water damage but also protects against falls or other impacts. This waterproof iPhone case scores an IP68 rating, meaning it can be completely submerged in water to a depth of 6.6 feet for up to an hour. It seals your phone inside while allowing the Touch ID, touchscreen, and camera to work just fine. There are button covers for the controls and ports for audio, however, you may notice the sound is a bit muffled occasionally.</p><h2 id=title class="a-size-large a-spacing-none">Vansky Floatable Waterproof Case</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>If you don’t need constant waterproof protection for your iPhone 7, then a better option could simply be a dry bag like the Vansky. Pop your iPhone in the bag and seal it, and you’re set. The case has an IPX8 rating and promises to keep your handset safe in depths of up to 100 feet. It comes with a strap that you can shrink or enlarge to fit your neck, arm, wrist, or ankle. Both the front and back are clear, allowing you to use your iPhone while it’s in the bag. Another cool thing that sets this bag apart is that it floats, so if you drop your iPhone, it won’t disappear into the depths.</p><h4 class="b-editors-recs-title h-editors-recs-title">Editors' Recommendations</h4><span id=publisher-md itemprop=publisher itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/Organization><span itemprop=url itemtype=https://schema.org/Url content="https://www.digitaltrends.com"><span itemprop=logo itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXGoquapKSnsq%2Bw0meaqKVforyjtcueZpudo6l6uK3Tnqmpqp%2Bks261z6Gmp51dbHqkrdKeqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./super-bowl-chocolate-covered-pretzel-brownies.html><span>←</span><span>Super Bowl Chocolate Covered Pretzel Brownies Modern Honey</span></a>
