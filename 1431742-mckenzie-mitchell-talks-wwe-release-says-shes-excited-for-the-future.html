You know, I think once the dust has settled, it’s been really, it’s a blessing,” McKenzie Mitchell said. “I think that there are so many new beginnings, and I’m excited to see what’s to come in the future. The outreach, and the support that I’ve gotten from friends, family, coworkers, colleagues, production, staff executives in WWE, the fans most importantly, it’s been insane.</p><p>“That’s what made me emotional when I got released was being able to hear from everyone how much I impacted their opinion in when watching WWE and when watching NXT. That’s what made me emotional was hearing from all of the people their favorite moments in my career and the favorite interviews that I’ve done and the magic that was created on screen like that made it made such a big impact on me to see what I made on them.”</p><h2 id=h-mckenzie-mitchell-on-processing-her-release>McKenzie Mitchell On Processing Her Release</h2><p>McKenzie Mitchell went on to describe how she has been processing the release.

And so I’ve been putting all my efforts into that into my creativity there. That’s almost my full-time. My husband still works within the company, obviously.</p><p>“So that’s really interesting that he’s still there, I’m not. I don’t know if people know but we were the first couple on the announce team. Like genuinely like that our announcer and announcer that are married. So we kind of like really figured it out there but I’m of course still supportive of WWE and NXT and I still watch him and I still text him good luck before every show.
