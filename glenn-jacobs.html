While they were stationed in Spain, Kane was born. But they later moved back to their own country soon after, and he grew up in St. Louis, Missouri.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Glenn-Jacobs-1.jpg><p class=p3><span class=s2>He had a good childhood, and his two siblings; used to have a lot of fun together.

Kane also played basketball and football there.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>If Kane were not a wrestler, he would have been a football player or basketball player as he was good in both. But Kane’s destiny had decided something else for him, and he became a wrestler instead.</span></p><p>You can also read about <strong><a href=#>John Cena’s Bio: Wife, Career, Song, WWE & Net Worth></a></strong></p><h2 class=p1><span class=s1>Glenn Jacobs: Professional Career</span></h2><p class=p3><span class=s2>In the first place, Kane never thought of being a wrestler; before he became a wrestler, he worked as an elementary school teacher.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>In 1997, Glenn debuted in WWE, and the Kane character was born that day. Likewise, if you don’t take part-time wrestlers like The Undertaker, Triple H, and The Rock into account, Kane is the only guy left standing in the WWE even after two-plus decades.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>Undoubtedly, Kane takes challenges, tests his capabilities, and pushes himself to do his best.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>Most of the wrestlers are capable of excelling in one particular role, but Glenn, who plays Kane, was given some awful gimmicks in his early career days, like Isaac Yankem DDS and Fake Diesel.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>But he gave his best; later, after he got the name of Kane’s character, he got more fame. At the beginning of Kane’s career, he debuted as one dominant, unstoppable, monstrous character.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>But later, he transformed himself to be one funny and good character ad well. Most of the time, he portrayed himself as an evil personality. Nonetheless, in one of the articles of WWE, Kane was ranked as the 41st best wrestling villain in the history of WWE.</span></p><h3 class=p3><span class=s2>Beginning Phase</span></h3><p class=p3><span class=s2>Kane’s journey started in 1992 from Independent Circuit as Angus King. Unfortunately, this gimmick was one of the disasters as any audience did not like it.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>With a series of losses and not a little appreciation from audiences, Kane left IC and joined WWE in 1995 as Mike Unabomb.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>At first, he was shown as a dentist of Jerry Lawler with a heavy body and the monstrous figure Jerry had hired to get rid of his then-rival Bret Hart.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Glenn-Jacobs-2.jpg><p class=p3><span class=s2>And the career turning point came for Kane in 1997 when he was introduced as Undertaker’s half-brother by their reel father, Paul Bearer.</span></p><p>Undertaker and Kane feuded with each other for a year, and then after reconciling, they were called The Brothers of Destruction.</p><p>In 2002 as Raw and SmackDown were formed after dividing WWE, Kane was drafted to Raw.</p><p>After that, WWE changed Kane’s character, showed him a tiny human, and started communicating with the audience.</p><p>Before that, he used to stay quiet, and nobody had heard Kane’s voice.</p><p>Kane’s feud with Triple H and Steve Austin was at its peak back then. Steve challenged Kane for a match in which Kane had to unmask himself if he lost, to which Glenn responded positively.</p><p>Finally, on June 23, 2003, on the episode of Raw, Kane unmasked himself and revealed his face.</p><h3>Furthermore,</h3><p>In 2004 Kane lost in Wrestlemania, but he fell in love with Lita. But Lita rejected Kane, so he kidnapped Lita, and on the same night, he also won the battle royal. This storyline continued for a year, and later after Kane lost to Edge, this feud and storyline ended.</p><p>Years went by. Kane was only being taken as an average wrestler; however, his tag team with Big Show was appreciated rather than him doing anything solo.</p><p>But Glenn’s time changed when he won the World Heavyweight Championship in2010.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2013 Glenn again started wearing his mask and went back to the vicious character. In 2018, Kane and Undertaker joined hands again to fight the Wyatt family, and all liked both their tie-up. Similarly, he also jams with Big show to fight the Wyatt family again.</p><p>In 2018 Kane also allied with Daniel Bryan; at that time, Kane acted funny and had a shift in his character. But after 2018, Kane started seeing less in WWE; he was only caught after months.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2021 Kane was inducted into the Hall of Fame list; however, he has not left WWE yet. Now, he is busy with his political career.</p><h3>Movies</h3><p>Glenn has also acted in many Hollywood movies, and he made his Hollywood debut in 2006 with See no Evil. In 2007 he was in one episode of Smallville. Some of the famous films he has been part of are:</p><ul><li>See No Evil and its 2014 sequel</li><li>Countdown</li><li>MacGruber Tanker Lutz</li><li>The Last of the Mohicans Additional Crew</li></ul><h3>Glenn Jacobs: Politics</h3><p>Glenn has been actively working in politics since 2008. But in 2016, he shared his desire to take active participation in politics, to which he got positive responses from a lot of people.</p><p>In March 2017, Glenn announced that he was officially running for the mayoral seat of Knox County as a Republican.
