She completed the look with a pair of oversized sunglasses that were made with a retro square shape.

I just want you to know I just bent my knee … just bent it and it hurt. It was like ouch, which is exactly what happens when I wake up in the morning now,” Ross told her followers. “I wake up at 50 —&nbsp;hot as ever —&nbsp;and it’s as if someone beat me up while I was asleep. Who knew this was actually going to be real?”</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><a href=#><strong>Viola Davis</strong></a> agreed with Ross in the comments section, writing: “Yup! Me, too!! But you wear it well (50)!” A fan, meanwhile, praised the post, sharing: “I just want to be you when I grow up!” A third follower added: “Tracee Ellis Ross in a pool is my favorite genre!”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Ross celebrated her milestone birthday in October 2022 with a glitzy bash that was attended by Hollywood’s biggest names, including her superstar mom, <a href=#><strong>Diana Ross</strong></a>. <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a> was also present and <a href=#>made quite the entrance</a> in <a href=#>Halloween attire</a> despite the soirée not being a costume party.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“That time I showed up to a birthday dinner in full costume when it wasn’t a costume party!” the Skims cofounder, 42, joked via her Instagram on October 30. “Happy Birthday&nbsp;to the most beautiful kind soul.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The Kardashians star included a photo of herself — dressed in her elaborate Mystique costume — posing with Ross. As the Hulu personality noted, the Little star was not wearing a costume, instead opting for a glamorous red gown with an off-the-shoulder jacket.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvTq5icnZVisq24yKxkq6ejqHqlrdmzo56rXZ67brjEqKeaqpRivbO1za1km6Gbnruqec%2Bhpq2no2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shelley-winters-net-worth-184538.html><span>←</span><span>Shelley Winters Net Worth</span></a>
