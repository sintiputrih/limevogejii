<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Storage Wars (Reality Show) Cast Now In 2023</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Because of A&E’s penchant for producing reality shows on less glamorous industries, “Storage Wars,” the network’s most popular programme, was born. It centred on bringing attention to the vanishing craft of auctioneering. The programme followed experienced buyers as they visited California storage facilities where lockers containing unwanted belongings were for sale. “Storage Wars'” competitive atmosphere made for excellent television as the programme went on to become a huge success. The show attracted 5.1 million viewers for the start of its second season after making its debut in 2010. The Hollywood Reporter claims that this cemented their position as A&E’s most popular season opener.</p><p>By creating a number of spinoffs, the network hoped to prolong the life of “Storage Wars” and recapture its enchantment. Longtime viewers were uncertain whether or not their beloved <a href=#>reality show</a> had finished when their 12-season run came to an end with the news of an indefinite sabbatical. Fortunately, the show made its eagerly anticipated comeback in 2021, with the majority of its original cast members returning to indulge their televised treasure-hunting desires. During its brief break, several of its stars either completely left the world of auctioning or used the fame they had achieved on the show to advance their professional careers. However, the original cast is still in good health. Here is a picture of our favourite treasure seekers today, along with some of their most recent adventures.</p><p class=toc_title>Table Of Content</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> Barry Weiss is a ‘born-again bidder’</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> Brandi Passante co-hosts a podcast</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">3</span> Brandon Sheets transitioned into a family man</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">4</span> Dan and Laura Dotson experienced several health scares</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">5</span> Darrell Sheets is enjoying his retired life</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">6</span> Dave Hester’s spending time away from reality television</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">7</span> Edwina Registre and Shana Dahan founded Throw It in the Cart LV</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">8</span> Ivy Calvin still runs a thrift store in California</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">9</span> Jarrod Schulz has moved on from Brandi Passante</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">10</span> Kenny Crossley is on a weight-loss journey</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">11</span> Mary Padian promotes businesses she believes in</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">12</span> Rene and Casey Nezhoda occasionally stumble upon celebrity items</a></li></ul><h3><span id=Barry_Weiss_is_a_8216born-again_bidder8217>Barry Weiss is a ‘born-again bidder’<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/barry-weiss-is-a-born-again-bidder-1673292253.jpg alt="storage wars yup guy dies,cast of storage wars 2022,storage wars cast dies,storage wars season 15 cast,storage wars season 13 cast,storage wars 2022 schedule,storage wars where are they now 2022,storage hunters cast death,storage wars season 14 cast,storage wars cast now 2022,storage wars texas cast where are they now,storage wars canada cast where are they now,storage wars cast then and now,storage wars texas cast now,storage wars original cast where are they now,storage wars cast 2019,where are the original storage wars cast,storage wars cast 2013,what are storage wars cast doing now,storage hunters vs storage wars,parking wars cast now,what happened to parking wars cast" width=780 height=438 sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Barry Weiss went on “Storage Wars” the year “Storage Wars” premiered in the same year “Storage Wars” made its television series “Storage Wars” would find its way onto “Storage Wars” the same year “Storage Wars The show’s star, “The Collector,” would exploit his success to take the lead in a spinoff called “Barry’s Treasure.” But due to underwhelming ratings, the show was cancelled the same year it made its debut. Weiss would eventually quit reality television to return to his profession as a “world-class slacker” (via YouTube).</p><p>The former reality star had a difficult year in 2019, as he would be engaged in a motorbike <a href=#>accident</a> and sustain injuries that required multiple surgeries to address (per TMZ). Weiss appears to have been moving slowly ever since his accident. Fans questioned whether or not we will see our favourite treasure hunter back on the big screen when “Storage Wars” returned in 2021. Fortunately, Weiss’s comeback on the show’s Season 14 debut fulfilled our highest expectations (via The Sun). Weiss appeared to be in high spirits and said he was ready to resume his vintage hunting routine after a protracted time of rehabilitation. A lot of things have changed with me over the past seven years, he claimed. “Working with a bidding coach has been helpful. I eliminated arugula entirely. I feel like an entirely new bidder.”</p><h3><span id=Brandi_Passante_co-hosts_a_podcast>Brandi Passante co-hosts a podcast<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/brandi-passante-co-hosts-a-podcast-1673292253.jpg alt="storage wars yup guy dies,cast of storage wars 2022,storage wars cast dies,storage wars season 15 cast,storage wars season 13 cast,storage wars 2022 schedule,storage wars where are they now 2022,storage hunters cast death,storage wars season 14 cast,storage wars cast now 2022,storage wars texas cast where are they now,storage wars canada cast where are they now,storage wars cast then and now,storage wars texas cast now,storage wars original cast where are they now,storage wars cast 2019,where are the original storage wars cast,storage wars cast 2013,what are storage wars cast doing now,storage hunters vs storage wars,parking wars cast now,what happened to parking wars cast" width=780 height=438 sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>After Brandi Passante left “Storage Wars” in 2014, a brief spinoff series named “Brandi and Jarrod: Married to the Job” was released. A&E chose to cancel the programme after just one season due to the show’s unimpressive ratings, forcing Passante to resume her normal life and rejoin “Storage Wars.” Over the following few years, her relationship with Jarrod Schulz would deteriorate, leading to their separation in 2018. (per People). The Now and Then Second Hand Store, their joint endeavour, is no longer open for business (per MSN).</p><p>Passante was successful outside of her full-time job as a treasure hunter, despite the fact that this may appear hopeless for the no-nonsense buyer herself. She would join Hammer Brunch on the podcast “Happening Now with Hammer” on a regular basis, it was confirmed in 2021. Passante and Brunch get along so well that he offers her a regular seat on the podcast. Passante appears to have taken advantage of this chance because she has subsequently made an appearance in practically every weekly programme. Passante even invited her “Storage Wars” co-stars to join the show in 2022 to explain their selection processes (per “Happening Now with Hammer”).</p><h3><span id=Brandon_Sheets_transitioned_into_a_family_man>Brandon Sheets transitioned into a family man<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/brandon-sheets-transitioned-into-a-family-man-1673303287.jpg alt="storage wars yup guy dies,cast of storage wars 2022,storage wars cast dies,storage wars season 15 cast,storage wars season 13 cast,storage wars 2022 schedule,storage wars where are they now 2022,storage hunters cast death,storage wars season 14 cast,storage wars cast now 2022,storage wars texas cast where are they now,storage wars canada cast where are they now,storage wars cast then and now,storage wars texas cast now,storage wars original cast where are they now,storage wars cast 2019,where are the original storage wars cast,storage wars cast 2013,what are storage wars cast doing now,storage hunters vs storage wars,parking wars cast now,what happened to parking wars cast" width=780 height=438 sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Brandon Sheets, better known as “Sidebet,” joined the main cast of “Storage Wars” from the show’s premiere until Season 9. He is also the son of fellow cast member Darrell Sheets (per Instagram). When he left the show, many viewers wondered if he was still friendly with the show’s producers. Due to their inability to continue funding the actors in the same way as in previous seasons, A&E chose to make some wage cuts. Brandon was finally fired as a result of this. On his now-deleted Twitter account, he expressed his resentment about this (per TV Shows Ace).</p><p>Despite the deterioration of his connection with A&E, Brandon Sheets was able to adjust to the abrupt shift in course. In Arizona, “Sidebet” obtained a real estate agent licence, according to his Facebook. However, this seems to be short-lived because according to his Facebook profile, he is no longer offering real estate services. Brandon has subsequently changed, becoming a UPS driver and a “family man,” according to his Instagram. While “Storage Wars” returned to television in 2021, Brandon seems to have moved on from that chapter of his life. The fact that pervasive noticeably missing him being felt throughout the wholeheartedly felt throughout the absence is felt throughout the the show, but given that Brandon is noticeably missing him being felt throughout the the entire series, it may be for the best given that void throughout the the</p><h3><span id=Dan_and_Laura_Dotson_experienced_several_health_scares>Dan and Laura Dotson experienced several health scares<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dan-and-laura-dotson-experienced-several-health-scares-1673292253.jpg alt="storage wars yup guy dies,cast of storage wars 2022,storage wars cast dies,storage wars season 15 cast,storage wars season 13 cast,storage wars 2022 schedule,storage wars where are they now 2022,storage hunters cast death,storage wars season 14 cast,storage wars cast now 2022,storage wars texas cast where are they now,storage wars canada cast where are they now,storage wars cast then and now,storage wars texas cast now,storage wars original cast where are they now,storage wars cast 2019,where are the original storage wars cast,storage wars cast 2013,what are storage wars cast doing now,storage hunters vs storage wars,parking wars cast now,what happened to parking wars cast" width=780 height=438 sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>In a HuffPost interview, Laura referred to her initial meeting with Dan as “love at first sight.” The two met in 1996 at an auction and went on to find love and establish a lasting business partnership (per American Auctioneers). Their mutual success eventually led to their participation in “Storage Wars,” of which they were a member from its inception. Despite the fact that the show was a huge hit after its 2010 premiere, A&E’s financial troubles forced our favourite power couple to leave the show in Season 10.</p><p>They returned to operate their business, American Auctioneers, full-time after leaving “Storage Wars.” That is, until the show returned in 2021, which led to the pair’s comeback to their on-screen endeavours. However, despite their achievement, they experienced a number of health concerns that they are still aware of now. Dan almost lost a finger in a dog fight, had a double brain aneurysm, and Dan and Laura almost lost their son, Garrett, to gun violence in 2020. (per TMZ). On September 13, 2022, Dan posted a message on Facebook “On this day, two years ago, Laura and I are incredibly grateful that God spared our son. The shooter was apprehended, convicted, and given a 10.5-year sentence.” The two appear to be as upbeat and motivated today as they were prior to their newfound celebrity.</p><h3><span id=Darrell_Sheets_is_enjoying_his_retired_life>Darrell Sheets is enjoying his retired life<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/derrell-sheets-is-enjoying-his-retired-life-1673292253.jpg alt="storage wars yup guy dies,cast of storage wars 2022,storage wars cast dies,storage wars season 15 cast,storage wars season 13 cast,storage wars 2022 schedule,storage wars where are they now 2022,storage hunters cast death,storage wars season 14 cast,storage wars cast now 2022,storage wars texas cast where are they now,storage wars canada cast where are they now,storage wars cast then and now,storage wars texas cast now,storage wars original cast where are they now,storage wars cast 2019,where are the original storage wars cast,storage wars cast 2013,what are storage wars cast doing now,storage hunters vs storage wars,parking wars cast now,what happened to parking wars cast" width=780 height=438 sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Darrell Sheets is all too familiar with a life that is full of danger and reward. After a distinguished career in treasure seeking, “the Gambler” became interested in exhibiting his good fortune on “Storage Wars.” Sheets has demonstrated his mastery of his trade with his collection of comic <a href=#>books</a> and the discovery of $300,000-worth of Frank Gutierrez artwork. Sadly, the highs he would have wouldn’t adequately prepare him for the lows he would endure in 2019. Sheets posted on social media that year that he had suffered a heart attack (per People). According to his Instagram, Sheets had to have heart surgery due to the severity of the medical condition. He thanked everyone for their well wishes in the Instagram post. “I’m going to put everything I have into regenerating this fine old heart. I’m not going to quit. I have no regrets because I have come so far and had such a fantastic life.”</p><p>Darrell Sheets has seemed to be enjoying his life as a retired buyer ever since his health issues. Sheets, who resides in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, is still active on Instagram and frequently shares heartfelt messages about his granddaughter Zoie and his former partner Kimber. Nevertheless, Sheets would appear again in “Storage Wars” Seasons 13 and 14. Despite the fact that Sheets only makes brief appearances on the show, he seems content with the life he has now.</p><h3><span id=Dave_Hester8217s_spending_time_away_from_reality_television>Dave Hester’s spending time away from reality television<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dave-hesters-spending-time-away-from-reality-television-1673292253.jpg alt="storage wars yup guy dies,cast of storage wars 2022,storage wars cast dies,storage wars season 15 cast,storage wars season 13 cast,storage wars 2022 schedule,storage wars where are they now 2022,storage hunters cast death,storage wars season 14 cast,storage wars cast now 2022,storage wars texas cast where are they now,storage wars canada cast where are they now,storage wars cast then and now,storage wars texas cast now,storage wars original cast where are they now,storage wars cast 2019,where are the original storage wars cast,storage wars cast 2013,what are storage wars cast doing now,storage hunters vs storage wars,parking wars cast now,what happened to parking wars cast" width=780 height=438 sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Fans and cast members alike may agree that Dave Hester was the major adversary of “Storage Wars,” despite the reality show’s delight in showcasing the aggressive local bidders. Although he wears the show’s most famous tagline on his hat (which you can see above), he has a reputation for upsetting people when he is around. His three-year tenure culminated in a courtroom confrontation where he charged A&E with fabricating the drama of the programme (via Los Angeles Times). Despite rumours that he had been terminated, the treasure hunter was rehired for Season 5. Hester would later have a stroke in 2018, which would keep him in the hospital for days (via TMZ). Hester had to relearn how to walk and take a shower as a result of her near-death experience.</p><p>Hester was able to return for Season 12, but the short hiatus caused him to switch his attention from reality TV to his auction house. Many people have concluded that Hester has completely exited the world of storage auctions because he hasn’t appeared in recent seasons of “Storage Wars.” But according to his Twitter, Hester is still actively involved in the local auction scene and frequently advertises his participation at California auctions. Hester seemed to have joyfully left the life of a reality TV star behind so that he can follow his vocation independently.</p><h3><span id=Edwina_Registre_and_Shana_Dahan_founded_Throw_It_in_the_Cart_LV>Edwina Registre and Shana Dahan founded Throw It in the Cart LV<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/edwina-registre-and-shana-dahan-founded-throw-it-in-the-cart-lv-1673292253.jpg alt="storage wars yup guy dies,cast of storage wars 2022,storage wars cast dies,storage wars season 15 cast,storage wars season 13 cast,storage wars 2022 schedule,storage wars where are they now 2022,storage hunters cast death,storage wars season 14 cast,storage wars cast now 2022,storage wars texas cast where are they now,storage wars canada cast where are they now,storage wars cast then and now,storage wars texas cast now,storage wars original cast where are they now,storage wars cast 2019,where are the original storage wars cast,storage wars cast 2013,what are storage wars cast doing now,storage hunters vs storage wars,parking wars cast now,what happened to parking wars cast" width=780 height=438 sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Las Vegas friends Edwina Registre and Shana Dahan formed Throw It in the Cart LV A&E, Instagram Edwina Registre and Shana Dahan joined “Storage Wars” in Season 11 as late additions (per Facebook). The unbreakable couple immediately assimilated into the original group of buyers. The two pursued careers as <a href=#>insurance</a> brokers after becoming close friends in high school. They frequently went to auctions together whenever they had the opportunity (per A&E).</p><p>Their off-screen activities appear to have kept them occupied while they were away from the show. They both run an enthusiastic pair of up-cyclers, two pair of up-cyclers pairs, and two pair of up-cyclers pairs. The two pair run an enthusiastic up-cyclers pair, the two run their avid up-cyclers on their two According to their Instagram, the two started Throw it in the Cart LV in 2021 in addition to their vlogging endeavours. It appears that the two are accumulating enough merchandise to post their most recent finds on the website. Although they were able to work with a local Nevada Salvation Army store to have their own personal part of clothing items available to the public, this didn’t stop them from pursuing other employment. The Vegas Ladies will not be part of the primary cast of buyers when “Storage Wars” is back in 2021. The two appear to be largely focused on their endeavours outside of “Storage Wars,” despite the fact that they have never publicly explained why this is the case.</p><h3><span id=Ivy_Calvin_still_runs_a_thrift_store_in_California>Ivy Calvin still runs a thrift store in California<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ivy-calvin-still-runs-a-thrift-store-in-california-1673292253.jpg alt="storage wars yup guy dies,cast of storage wars 2022,storage wars cast dies,storage wars season 15 cast,storage wars season 13 cast,storage wars 2022 schedule,storage wars where are they now 2022,storage hunters cast death,storage wars season 14 cast,storage wars cast now 2022,storage wars texas cast where are they now,storage wars canada cast where are they now,storage wars cast then and now,storage wars texas cast now,storage wars original cast where are they now,storage wars cast 2019,where are the original storage wars cast,storage wars cast 2013,what are storage wars cast doing now,storage hunters vs storage wars,parking wars cast now,what happened to parking wars cast" width=780 height=438 sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Ivy Calvin, who has experience in both arena football and mixed martial arts, gave Season 3’s “Storage Wars” a competitive edge (per History). The king of Palmdale developed a penchant for used storage goods before starting his full-time job as a TV treasure hunter. He would travel from state to state in search of uncommon artefacts for his California-based thrift business, Grandma’s Attic. His participation in “Storage Wars” would increase awareness of his company and enable him to make a reliable living outside of reality television. In 2020, co-stars Rene and Casey Nezhoda even went to his thrift shop and found old toys, sphere radios, straight razors, and other items (via YouTube).</p><p>2019’s break from the show would allow Calvin to focus entirely on growing his company. He was able to spend more time with his wife and two sons during his hiatus from “Storage Wars” (per Distractify). Little is known about his life outside of auctioning other from his business. Despite this, the stoic buyer himself appears to be active on Instagram, promoting his thrift shop and displaying his most recent finds, which range from top-quality Michael Kors handbags to Pokémon cards.</p><h3><span id=Jarrod_Schulz_has_moved_on_from_Brandi_Passante>Jarrod Schulz has moved on from Brandi Passante<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jarrod-schulz-has-moved-on-from-brandi-passante-1673292253.jpg alt="storage wars yup guy dies,cast of storage wars 2022,storage wars cast dies,storage wars season 15 cast,storage wars season 13 cast,storage wars 2022 schedule,storage wars where are they now 2022,storage hunters cast death,storage wars season 14 cast,storage wars cast now 2022,storage wars texas cast where are they now,storage wars canada cast where are they now,storage wars cast then and now,storage wars texas cast now,storage wars original cast where are they now,storage wars cast 2019,where are the original storage wars cast,storage wars cast 2013,what are storage wars cast doing now,storage hunters vs storage wars,parking wars cast now,what happened to parking wars cast" width=780 height=438 sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Our favourite arguing pair, Jarrod Schulz and Brandi Passante, would live on in the weekly episode of “Storage Wars.” From their initial encounter at a carpet-cleaning business in 1999 to their subsequent attendance at auctions, the unusual duo soon won over fans (per The Orange County Register). This ultimately led A&E to create “Brandi and Jarrod: Married to the Job,” their own show, to capitalise on their popularity.</p><p>Fans anticipated seeing the quick-witted duo follow their broadcast passion for treasure hunting together when “Storage Wars” returned in 2021. However, Passante revealed in a confessional that the two split up in 2018 thus this wouldn’t be the case (via People). Although they were no longer together, Schulz was confident that their on-screen endeavours would not be affected, saying, “Just because me and Brandi aren’t together anymore doesn’t mean we can’t go to an auction — but separately.” In terms of his commercial endeavours, the “Young Gun” once owned the apparel line Outlaw Apparel and currently owns the Rush Bar and Grill. Despite Schulz moving on, he would be charged with domestic violence after a fight with Passante (via TMZ). Even if the incident happened in 2021, it’s possible that this is what kept him out of “Storage Wars” Season 14.</p><h3><span id=Kenny_Crossley_is_on_a_weight-loss_journey>Kenny Crossley is on a weight-loss journey<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/kenny-crossley-is-on-a-weight-loss-journey-1673292253.jpg alt="storage wars yup guy dies,cast of storage wars 2022,storage wars cast dies,storage wars season 15 cast,storage wars season 13 cast,storage wars 2022 schedule,storage wars where are they now 2022,storage hunters cast death,storage wars season 14 cast,storage wars cast now 2022,storage wars texas cast where are they now,storage wars canada cast where are they now,storage wars cast then and now,storage wars texas cast now,storage wars original cast where are they now,storage wars cast 2019,where are the original storage wars cast,storage wars cast 2013,what are storage wars cast doing now,storage hunters vs storage wars,parking wars cast now,what happened to parking wars cast" width=780 height=438 sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>In Season 3 of “Storage Wars,” Kenny Crossley would finally achieve success on reality television. Even though he was cheery, this praline king had a career in police enforcement prior to working as a manager of a storage facility (via A&E). Due to his involvement in the auction industry, he met Barry Weiss, a successful businessman, with whom he would later develop a close relationship.</p><p>Even though Kenny Crossley joined “Storage Wars” late, he instantly won our hearts with his witty catchphrases and sincere demeanour. Fans have been curious to learn how many interests Crossley actually has ever since the show’s brief hiatus in 2019 because of this. Crossley made use of the time the epidemic gave him to pursue his creative interests, such as publishing beats under the alias “Dualpersona” and starting a YouTube channel where he shares his appreciation for common foods. But later, his love of eating would serve as the impetus for a significant shift. Crossley said in an Instagram video on August 31, 2022, that he is starting his own weight-loss journey. “I think it’s that moment,” he said, “that time to modify everything, including the way I’m eating, and to give myself a gift.” We can’t help but applaud Crossley because she has accomplished an amazing feat.</p><h3><span id=Mary_Padian_promotes_businesses_she_believes_in>Mary Padian promotes businesses she believes in<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mary-padian-promotes-businesses-she-believes-in-1673292253.jpg alt="storage wars yup guy dies,cast of storage wars 2022,storage wars cast dies,storage wars season 15 cast,storage wars season 13 cast,storage wars 2022 schedule,storage wars where are they now 2022,storage hunters cast death,storage wars season 14 cast,storage wars cast now 2022,storage wars texas cast where are they now,storage wars canada cast where are they now,storage wars cast then and now,storage wars texas cast now,storage wars original cast where are they now,storage wars cast 2019,where are the original storage wars cast,storage wars cast 2013,what are storage wars cast doing now,storage hunters vs storage wars,parking wars cast now,what happened to parking wars cast" width=780 height=438 sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>In an effort to capitalise on “Storage Wars'” success, A&E selected a number of spinoffs in locations other than California. One saw them follow local treasure seekers in Texas, which led in a new cast member who would later join the original team of buyers. Mary Padian, also known as “the Junkster,” attracted the attention of the show’s producers with her skill at restoring unusual items, which led to her inclusion in Season 5.</p><p>Mary Padian is all too familiar with transitioning after a show’s failure given her past as a reality star. When “Storage Wars” was no longer on television in 2019, Padian resumed her previous way of life. Thanks to her involvement in “Storage Wars,” she was able to find success with her store, “Mary’s Finds.” Padian has since been updating her online catalogue to satisfy her fanbase, offering everything from retro home decor to charitable bracelets. However, it appears that she will be concentrating on using her platform in 2022 to support brands she supports, such as environmentally friendly and women-owned businesses (via Instagram). Although the reason for her absence from “Storage Wars” Season 14 is unknown, it appears that our favourite bright-eyed “Junkster” is having the time of her life away from reality television.</p><h3><span id=Rene_and_Casey_Nezhoda_occasionally_stumble_upon_celebrity_items>Rene and Casey Nezhoda occasionally stumble upon celebrity items<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/rene-and-casey-nezhoda-occasionally-stumble-upon-storage-units-owned-by-celebrities-1673292253.jpg alt="storage wars yup guy dies,cast of storage wars 2022,storage wars cast dies,storage wars season 15 cast,storage wars season 13 cast,storage wars 2022 schedule,storage wars where are they now 2022,storage hunters cast death,storage wars season 14 cast,storage wars cast now 2022,storage wars texas cast where are they now,storage wars canada cast where are they now,storage wars cast then and now,storage wars texas cast now,storage wars original cast where are they now,storage wars cast 2019,where are the original storage wars cast,storage wars cast 2013,what are storage wars cast doing now,storage hunters vs storage wars,parking wars cast now,what happened to parking wars cast" width=780 height=438 sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Rene and Casey Nezhoda started appearing as buyers in Season 4 of “Storage Wars.” As a result, they eventually gained popularity as television treasure hunters because the other purchasers on the show thought the two were a terrific team. The two capitalised on their rising celebrity by starting a YouTube channel as their popularity increased.</p><p>They acquired storage lockers filled with historical mementos from well-known celebrities like Farrah Fawcett as a result of their off-screen activities (per YouTube). At one point, they acquired Kobe Bryant-related goods (per Bleacher Report). The final items Rene had from Bryant’s storage unit will be up for sale on Whatnot, an online marketplace for secondhand goods, he announced on Instagram on December 27, 2022. Rene and Casey Nezhoda regularly update their Instagram to showcase their latest purchases, advertise their YouTube channel, or share personal details with their followers. This is in addition to their passion for resale. Rene and Casey have continued to play our favourite treasure-hunting team since the resumption of the show.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt="storage wars yup guy dies,cast of storage wars 2022,storage wars cast dies,storage wars season 15 cast,storage wars season 13 cast,storage wars 2022 schedule,storage wars where are they now 2022,storage hunters cast death,storage wars season 14 cast,storage wars cast now 2022,storage wars texas cast where are they now,storage wars canada cast where are they now,storage wars cast then and now,storage wars texas cast now,storage wars original cast where are they now,storage wars cast 2019,where are the original storage wars cast,storage wars cast 2013,what are storage wars cast doing now,storage hunters vs storage wars,parking wars cast now,what happened to parking wars cast" itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.
