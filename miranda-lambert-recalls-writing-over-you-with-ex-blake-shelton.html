Though both singers have spoken about their marriage since the divorce, the Grammy winner usually <a href=#>brings up her ex-husband more subtly</a>.</p><p>“I moved here in 2015 in the middle of a s–t show, but I was lifted up by people who were like, ‘We got you, girl.’ My friends and my songwriters and my fans and everybody here,” Lambert said during a Nashville concert in January 2020, alluding to the timing of the split.</p><p>Both Lambert and Shelton have moved on since their divorce. The “Mama’s Broken Heart” crooner is married to <a href=#><strong>Brendan McLoughlin</strong></a>, while Shelton is <a href=#>engaged to singer</a> <a href=#><strong>Gwen Stefani</strong></a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When <a href=#>Lambert married the former New York City police officer</a> in February 2019 after a whirlwind romance, <a href=#>Shelton did not hear about the wedding in advance</a>.</p><p>“Blake was not given a heads-up and doesn’t know her new husband,” a source told Us exclusively at the time. “Since they split they have had almost zero contact.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamoaKWu6WtjKWYppqVp8FuvsScmKWko2LEs7XToqWgZZ%2BrsrN52KisZq%2BZqbVusddmmaWZm5p6tLTEpauopl8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kenny-bednarek-kung-fu-kenny-youth-t-shirt.html><span>←</span><span>Kenny Bednarek &amp;quot;Kung Fu Kenny&amp;quot; Youth T-Shirt</span></a>
