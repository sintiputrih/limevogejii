Mylah even picked up the shoe and pretended to throw it at her mom during the recording.</p><p>Yara pretended to fall over, lying on the grass, as Gwen clapped and had a laugh.</p><p>Yara captioned the video, “@gweneymard&nbsp;tried to race with me 😂😂 . . . #fun&nbsp;#motherinlaw.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-90-day-fiance-fans-love-seeing-yara-zaya-have-fun-with-her-mother-in-law-gwen-eymard>90 Day Fiance fans love seeing Yara Zaya have fun with her mother-in-law, Gwen Eymard</h2><p>Yara’s post was well received by her hundreds of thousands of Instagram followers, receiving nearly 25,000 likes in less than 24 hours.</p><p>In the comments section, one 90 Day Fiance fan wrote, “I would watch your family if you guys had your own show.
