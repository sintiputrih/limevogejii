Well Wally IS deemed as a rival officially. On the Bulbapedia rivals page, Wally is listed as one of the Hoenn rivals. As for the starter thing, true N did not receive a starter in the games but neither did Wally. In the manga however, N is in possession of White's Tepig. So unless that changes, I think the manga deems N as one of those "non-Pokedex rivals". As for the people saying N can't be a rival because he's a villainous team leader, that's not true.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Sister Wives' Robyn Brown: Quarantine Time With Kody Was 'Not Fair'</h2><time>Oct 4, 2024</time>
