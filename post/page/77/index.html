Dua Lipa is breathing new life into every bow lover’s favorite trend.
The “Dance the Night” singer attended Thursday night’s Time100 Gala in New York City wearing a new take on the coquette trend. This involved a bejeweled long-sleeved gown, custom-made by Chanel, featuring ornate silver scalloped details all over. The shape of the neckline provided some necessary edge, with a deep plunging V arcing into a keyhole cutout over her belly button, punctuated by a prim black bow adorned with a floral brooch.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How Rich Is Ray J?

Whether you are talking about a Baseball America top-10 prospect like Jarred Kelenic or a player like Ha-Seong Kim, who left the Korean Baseball Organization to start fresh in the United States, fantasy players routinely push their chips all-in on the rookies with the hope of discovering the next big thing.
