The old saying goes, “You can’t keep a good man down.” Essentially, this is the meaning of Proverbs 24:16: “For though a righteous man falls seven times, he rises again.” A person who trusts in the Lord and depends on God throughout his life may trip and fall over and over again, but he won’t stay down. He will overcome obstacles and challenges by God’s grace and strength, dusting himself off and rising again.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What is the April Theory on TikTok?

<a href=../../../trailer-josh-hartnetts-bunraku.html></a>
Recommended Videos A trailer has landed for the wacky indie film Bunraku. Starring a decent cast that consists of&nbsp;Josh Hartnett,&nbsp;Woody Harrelson,&nbsp;Gackt,&nbsp;Ron Perlman,&nbsp;Demi Moore and&nbsp;Kevin McKidd, the film looks pretty over the top but still genuinely fun. It’s been making its way through the festival circuit and while it hasn’t been getting good reviews, I really don’t think it looks that bad.
The highly stylized martial arts film may be a bit too out there for some but despite the poor reviews, I’m kind of interested in Bunraku.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>'Modern Family' Has so Many Options for a Spin-Off, but Will It Get One?</h2><time>Mar 13, 2024</time>
