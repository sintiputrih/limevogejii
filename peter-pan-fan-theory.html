That "evidence" can come in the form of artistic choices that seem a bit out of place, like the fact that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aladdin packs a ton of modern references to actors and cultural figures</a> that don't really have anything to do with Agrabah.</p><p>Oftentimes the theories themselves are challenges to accepted storylines and perceptions of who is actually "the real villain" of a piece, something that comes up in a lot of Disney films. The movies that many of us watched as children seem to take on a new meaning when we get older, which is perfectly encapsulated in this viral clip that makes a fairly strong point that Hook is actually the protagonist of Peter Pan.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Today Years Old (@todayyearsold)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram | @todayyearsold</span></figure><p>Reposted by @todayyearsold, the clip features a group of friends sitting in a car.

Because he's trying to stop him from kidnapping anymore kids. But everybody else sees it as him being the bad guy because Captain Hook never goes after the kids.
