Blessed with a truly incredible and powerful voice that is full of emotion, Adele also has the ability to write songs that tell stories that the masses can relate to. As a result, she has become so successful that <a href=#>Adele has enjoyed many impressive career milestones</a> and she has taken home a long list of accolades.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Adele’s ‘21’ Becomes First Female Record To Spend An Entire Decade On The Billboard 200</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately, no matter how much an artist accomplishes in the modern world, chances are there are always going to be haters looking to pull them down. For example, <a href=#>one of Adele’s exes once harassed her looking for money</a>. On top of that, unfortunately, there is a history of people body shaming Adele which is part of the reason why there is a heartbreaking truth about the singer’s weight loss.</p><h2 id=adele-says-anxiety-is-what-led-to-her-weight-loss>Adele Says Anxiety Is What Led To Her Weight Loss</h2><p>In this day and age, it often seems like virtually everyone is dealing with some kind of anxiety issues. While it is extremely important to stress that there is no shame in that and people should be more willing to talk about their mental health, it also is a shame that anyone has to go through that. For example, after she lost a lot of weight, she was interviewed by Vogue in 2021 and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adele revealed that her struggles with anxiety played a huge role in her body transformation</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Celebrities Who Have Incredible Weight Loss Stories</a></span></p><p>“It was because of my anxiety. Working out, I would just feel better. It was never about losing weight, it was always about becoming strong and giving myself as much time every day without my phone. I got quite addicted to it. I work out two or three times a day.”</p><p>On the one hand, that quote is inspiring since it is wonderful that Adele found an outlet for her anxiety and she seems to be very happy to be in a lot better shape. On the other hand, the fact that it took Adele so long to find a way to channel her anxiety is very sad. On top of that, if Adele continues to feel so anxious that she needs to work out multiple times a day to overcome it, that is unfortunate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-reaction-to-adele-rsquo-s-weight-loss-was-ldquo-brutal-rdquo>The Reaction To Adele’s Weight Loss Was “Brutal”</h2><p>During the same Vogue interview in which she revealed her newfound addiction to working out, Adele spoke about the way fans and the media have talked about her body. For example, early on in the interview, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adele remarked “my body’s been objectified my entire career”</a> and that certainly is true.</p><p>Even though Adele’s body never has been anyone else’s business, people have been commenting on it from the moment she became a star. Early on, that meant that far too many people harassed Adele for being larger than they thought she should be. Even though anyone who harassed the singer for that at the time only proved why they should be derided, that doesn’t mean that Adele wasn’t bothered by their remarks. In fact, the harassment was so bad and obvious that when she transformed her body, many people assumed <a href=#>Adele was harassed into losing weight</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the fact that Adele was harassed by people who thought she was too big for years, some people may have assumed that she would get nothing but love when she lost weight. Instead, it actually seems like the negative feedback Adele received for her body got even worse when she dropped some serious pounds. During the aforementioned Vogue interview, Adele expressed that she understood why some people were upset that she got smaller.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth Behind Adele Getting In The Best Shape Of Her Life</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I understand why it’s a shock. I understand why some women especially were hurt. Visually I represented a lot of women. But I’m still the same person.” However, Adele didn’t mince words when she was asked about the cruelty of some of the things people said after she transformed her figure. “The most brutal conversations were being had by other women about my body I was very f***ing disappointed with that. That hurt my feelings.”</p><p>Given the fact that she was harassed because she was too big and that things only got worse when she slimmed down, Adele’s weight loss reveals a heartbreaking truth about society. After all, Adele’s story proves that no matter what size a famous woman is, they get judged for their body. When you then factor in all of the other ways that female celebrities get judged for their looks, including their fashion, makeup, and hair choices, it is pretty sickening. On top of all that, stars like Adele get judged for everything they say during interviews too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Why Is Adele Facing Criticism For Her Oprah Interview?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIywnKKfmKl6pbXDZpidnZyaeq270p5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./queen-rania-of-jordan.html><span>←</span><span>Queen Rania of Jordan</span></a>
