Why? It's quite versatile. It has superb Special Attack and high Special Defense, as well as decent Attack, Defense, and HP, not to mention a whopping 11 resistences plus a Poison immunity. Its weaknesses (<a href=# title="Electric (type)">Electric</a>, <a href=# title="Fighting (type)">Fighting</a>, <a href=# title="Ground (type)">Ground</a>) are common, but those can be easily countered by the rest of your team. Its low Speed can be rectified by <a href=# title="Agility (move)">Agility</a>.</p><p>The most common Empoleon takes advantage of its Sp. Attack and decent Special movepool, as well as Agility and <a href=# title="Torrent (Ability)">Torrent</a>, to attempt to sweep the foe. It doesn't have a crazy huge movepool, but <a href=# title="Surf (move)">Surf</a>/<a href=# title="Hydro Pump (move)">Hydro Pump</a>, <a href=# title="Ice Beam (move)">Ice Beam</a>, and <a href=# title="Grass Knot (move)">Grass Knot</a> cover everything just fine. The <a href=# title="Water (type)">Water</a> moves, which get <a href=# class=mw-redirect title=STAB>STAB</a>, can become rather frightening when Torrent kicks in, hitting with 225% of their usual force!</p><p>That's not to say Empoleon can't successfully hit from the Physical spectrum. It has some useful Physical moves, most notably <a href=# title="Aqua Jet (move)">Aqua Jet</a>, as well as <a href=# title="Swords Dance (move)">Swords Dance</a> to make its Attack something scary.</p><p>And who said the emperor penguin can't take hits!? That 84/88/101 layout makes it a very durable Pokémon, especially with that awesome defensive typing that flips <a href=# title="Kingdra (Pokémon)">Kingdra</a> the (flightless) bird. While it lacks a good instant-recovery move, it can frustrate with <a href=# title="Toxic (move)">Toxic</a> or <a href=# title="Yawn (move)">Yawn</a>, or phaze with <a href=# title="Roar (move)">Roar</a>.</p><p>In summary, Empoleon has a lot of tricks up its... <i>wing</i>, so be ready for anything.</p><p><br><b>Agility SubPetaya</b> (Smogon)</p><p>Modest / Petaya Berry / Torrent</p>- Agility - Substitute - Surf - Ice Beam / Grass Knot<p>26 Defense / 252 Sp. Attack / 232 Speed</p><p><br>This can be deadly, especially as a late-game sweeper. It Subs down to 25% HP, then uses Agility as the last one breaks. With the Petaya Berry, STAB, and Torrent, Surf becomes absolutely devastating. The last move comes down to what you want to cover. Ice Beam is the more common choice, as it slams those Grass-types and Dragon-types, and provides good coverage. However, bulky Waters resist both, and <a href=# title="Vaporeon (Pokémon)">Vaporeon</a> laughs in your face, usually prepared to beat it down with <a href=# title="Hidden Power (move)">Hidden Power</a> Electric. Grass Knot covers those Waters, but now you have Grass-types (like <a href=# title="Celebi (Pokémon)">Celebi</a>) givin' you problems.</p><p><br><b>Agility, Three Attacks</b> (Smogon)</p><p>Modest / Life Orb / Torrent</p>- Surf / Hydro Pump - Ice Beam - Grass Knot - Agility<p>26 HP / 252 Sp. Attack / 232 Speed</p><p><br>This set lets you use both Ice Beam and Grass Knot for perfect coverage. The Life Orb gives you more than half the boost the Petaya Berry would, and the 10% HP loss eventually brings you down to the point where Torrent activates. Surf is the more reliable STAB attack, but Hydro Pump can destroy certain <a href=# title="Magnezone (Pokémon)">Magnezone</a>. Keep in mind that Vaporeon is still a problem. Why? It's not very heavy.</p><p><br><b>Lead</b> (Smogon)</p><p>Modest / Focus Sash / Torrent</p>- Hydro Pump - Aqua Jet - Stealth Rock - Ice Beam / Grass Knot<p>158 HP / 252 Sp. Attack / 100 Speed</p><p><br>Basically, a <a href=# title="Stealth Rock (move)">Stealth Rock</a> suicide lead that can also anti-lead. Hydro Pump inflicts massive amounts of damage, KO'ing <a href=# title="Hippowdon (Pokémon)">Hippowdon</a>, <a href=# title="Heatran (Pokémon)">Heatran</a>, and <a href=# title="Gliscor (Pokémon)">Gliscor</a>, and bringing frail leads, like <a href=# title="Aerodactyl (Pokémon)">Aerodactyl</a> and <a href=# title="Azelf (Pokémon)">Azelf</a>, down to their Sashes, allowing them to be slaughtered by the following Aqua Jet. That means they can only use one move. Grass Knot is usually chosen to deal with the ever-common <a href=# title="Swampert (Pokémon)">Swampert</a> lead, but Ice Beam is also viable. <a href=# title="Salamence (Pokémon)">Salamence</a> that try to <a href=# title="Dragon Dance (move)">dance like dragons</a> are surprised and KO'd. It's also a more accurate way of killing Gliscor. There is a big threat to this set: lead <a href=# title="Infernape (Pokémon)">Infernape</a> with <a href=# title="Fake Out (move)">Fake Out</a> and <a href=# title="Close Combat (move)">Close Combat</a>.</p><p><br><b>Anti-Lead</b> (SharKing)</p><p>Modest / Focus Sash / Torrent</p>- Hydro Pump - Aqua Jet - Ice Beam - Grass Knot<p>158 HP / 252 Sp. Attack / 100 Speed</p><p><br>Just a cheap revision of Smogon's Lead set. With this, you can focus on anti-leading and set up Stealth Rock with something else later. Infernape still looms over your forehead here.</p><p><br><b>Defensive Penguin</b> (Smogon, slightly edited)</p><p>Calm / Leftovers / Torrent</p>- Surf - Grass Knot - Ice Beam / Stealth Rock - Roar / Yawn / Knock Off / Toxic<p>252 HP / 160 Defense / 92 Sp. Defense / 6 Speed</p><p><br>A set that takes advantages of those many resistences. Surf is the main move, and it gives a scare to Ground-types, Heatran, and Infernape (on the switch-in). Grass Knot handles Swampert. You can use Ice Beam to KO Choice Specs Salamence, or any Mence on the switch, but Stealth Rock is also viable in that slot, since most Salamence carry <a href=# title="Earthquake (move)">Earthquake</a>/<a href=# title="Brick Break (move)">Brick Break</a>, anyway. The last slot has a lot to choose from. You can Roar to force a switch, or Yawn to either scare the foe into a switch or put something to sleep. Knock Off swats away those Life Orbs and Choice Items that sweepers carry, and also stops <a href=# title="Blissey (Pokémon)">Blissey</a> from healing a little every turn. Toxic is my own addition, and stall teams might like the building damage it causes. Unless, of course, you already have <a href=# title="Toxic Spikes (move)">Toxic Spikes</a>. The Defense EVs allow it to survive two Life Orb <a href=# title="Outrage (move)">Outrages</a> from Kingdra after a Dragon Dance.</p><p><br><b>Swords Dance + Priority</b> (Smogon)</p><p>Adamant / Leftovers / Torrent</p>- Swords Dance - Aqua Jet - Drill Peck - Earthquake / Avalanche<p>252 HP / 252 Attack / 6 Speed</p><p><br>A cheap imitation of Extreme Killer <a href=# title="Arceus (Pokémon)">Arceus</a>. Switch in on a resisted move, and Dance with Swords on the switch. If the foe switches to a Special wall like Blissey, they'll often reconsider and switch again, letting you get <i>another</i> Swords Dance in. With 31 IVs, this translates to an outright destructive 894 Attack! Aqua Jet is the main attack, and the priority is quite valuable. Base 40 power looks unappealing, but this Empoleon has STAB and the aforementioned outright destructive Attack stat; more than enough to make up for it. Drill Peck really hurts those Grass-types and Bug-types, especially <a href=# title="Breloom (Pokémon)">Breloom</a> (the Poke I hate most). You can choose Earthquake for a solid counter to Magnezone that switch in trying to trap you. Also hurts other Steels. Of course, Avalanche is a fine choice, too, as Water + <a href=# title="Ice (type)">Ice</a> is a cool attack type combo, and it slaughters Salamence. The decreased priority is risky, though.</p><p><br><b>Choice Specs</b> (Smogon)</p><p>Modest / Choice Specs / Torrent</p>- Surf / Hydro Pump - Ice Beam - Grass Knot - Sleep Talk / Hidden Power (Electric)<p>252 HP / 252 Sp. Attack / 6 Speed</p><p><br>With all those resistences and reduced Stealth Rock damage, Empoleon can find many chances to get in the fray. Surf is more reliable, but Hydro Pump KO's Magnezone if it hits. Ice Beam and Grass Knot are standard issue. You can use Sleep Talk to absorb Sleep and strike back, or you can use HP Electric to destroy <a href=# title="Gyarados (Pokémon)">Gyarados</a> and make it worse for <a href=# title="Tentacruel (Pokémon)">Tentacruel</a> and Vaporeon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorzEnaCaZpKquaOtxpqpnZ2eY7umwI6woKShX4rApr6ZjJ%2Baqnueu6h7r6iiXntjWo56uc6nlqiej6m1pqu2npyk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./2018-12-21-red-dead-redemption-2-jack-hall-gang-treasure-map-locations-4975.html><span>←</span><span>Red Dead Redemption 2 Jack Hall Gang Treasure Map locations</span></a>
