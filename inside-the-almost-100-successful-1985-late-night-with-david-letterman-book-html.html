Oh, man, almost. I’m sorry to say that the visuals sometimes don’t always enhance the writing and in a couple of cases distract. Many of the remotes are now up on YouTube and it’s better there? In particular, <a href=#>Dog Poetry</a> and <a href=#>The Late Night After School Special</a> are both flawless, and knowing that you could be actually watching them makes looking at screenshots in the book a little tough-going today.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t5z5x014x8b84wbn3wma1@published data-word-count=23>There are some layout issues as well, which in one case results in these two photos orphaned on an otherwise blank page 114.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t5z5x014y8b84aeukspeq@published data-word-count=56>Which, I guess that’s kind of beautiful, but maybe there was a better way?

And we all thought that sounded exciting. It was conceived of as a showcase for the writing. I guess that is just how we thought the show would be best showcased. Back in the beginning, we were specifically proud of the care we put into the writing. The book was supposed to showcase the comedy and one of the unique things about the comedy, in our minds back then, was the written material.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t5z5y01578b841q30fv16@published data-word-count=40><strong>The book includes a lot of the recurring segments from this period, about two years into the show. How did you go about selecting what would go into the book? Alternatively: Who complained the most about having to write something?</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t5z5y01588b84frk1crvw@published data-word-count=129>We sorted through hundreds of things and picked the stuff that was highest up on the ladder of our past comedy hits. Things we were pretty proud of. The pieces that seemed to be an example of the kind of interesting original thinking we were trying for, reduced to the ones that played well in front of the audience. We all knew what we meant by that. You probably weren’t even born yet so it’s hard for you to imagine people slaving over the writing of a nightly talk show back then. You probably imagine it being the 1300s and I guess in some ways it kind of was. We all came to work on ox carts. But we were really in to making the show unique and original.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t5z5y01598b84z1hsi1fb@published data-word-count=14>I don’t remember anyone complaining.

The idea for this may have come from me. No one wanted personal differentiation more than I did. And I was a big fan of humorous essays (and continue to be as we see in my latest book, <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Cool Calm and Contentious</a>). (You didn’t expect me to come all this way and not do a book plug, did you?) But back on topic, one difficulty of writing for TV is you don’t often get to hear your own voice. This seemed like a cool opportunity.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t5z5y015b8b849d29byhz@published data-word-count=106><strong>I have a couple questions about the images and the answers are probably either lost to time or not something you were involved with (or the questions are insulting) but: (1) the book is about 200 black and white pages, but there is a four-page color section in the middle of the book that includes “The Future” and “Camping with Barry White”; (2) there are a ton of photos from the show, and a lot of them have video “noise” in them – they look like photos taken of television monitors. The charitable version of my question is: What was the reason for these aesthetic choices?</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t5z5y015c8b84xmlpn4pq@published data-word-count=226>This was a big, big problem. We assumed when a network TV show signs on to do a book with a huge publishing house, it automatically means that there will be fabulous professional looking color photos, like ones we had seen in millions of other books. It never occurred to us that it could be any other way. Especially since we mentioned that the content would need photos. It’s not like we had never seen a book like that before. They weren’t an extreme rarity. Others had accomplished them. We assumed we would too. Then we saw the galleys and they were not only worse than what you are observing, they were filled with embarrassing nightmarish typos and lame photos. That was the first time we understood that the book wasn’t going to be like we imagined it would be… that there were apparently discussions we needed to have with someone contractually that had never taken place. Dave was extremely unhappy about this and from that point on pretty much washed his hands of it. He wouldn’t promote it. He sniped about it. He was really REALLY angry with me about it. But I had never done a book before. I had no idea… We were all pretty unhappy with everything about the final result except the words. They’re still pretty great. It’s really nicely written.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t5z5y015d8b841pr5uqex@published data-word-count=80><strong>I sometimes think of the original material created for the show as having a tough time making a case for itself. The fact that the show is on nightly and has had a spotty syndication history – or that the marketing of it is centered around guests with something immediate to sell – all of that has conditioned me to think of each show as impermanent, or at least more disposable than, say, an SNL sketch or a Simpsons episode.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t5z5y015e8b8440q0i9zj@published data-word-count=0></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t5z5y015f8b84zewdgjkd@published data-word-count=71><strong>One thing I love about the book is that it feels like a snapshot of the show and represents the very specific tone the writers were able to get. I guess I’m wondering what the sense was in writing these pieces: did it seem like you were always discarding a ton of work to get content for the next night, or were you aware that you were possibly inventing Judd Apatow?</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t5z5y015g8b843muy6c8l@published data-word-count=116>The show started out as a very written show. Everyone wanted it that way. We always did two to three written pieces, every night. The show set out to differentiate itself from the existing talk show genre by being a showcase for weird, interesting ideas and great writing. Within a few years, this had begun to wear on Dave. Too much rehearsal, for starters. And his standards of perfectionism were pretty difficult to meet on a nightly basis. It’s kind of a different show now. But back then, our intentions were pretty writerly. This book is a showcase of that effort. The people who were on the staff with me were all really good with words.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t5z5y015h8b840etkp7fs@published data-word-count=28><strong>Amazon currently offers a range of prices one might pay different resellers for this book, from one cent to $263.46.
