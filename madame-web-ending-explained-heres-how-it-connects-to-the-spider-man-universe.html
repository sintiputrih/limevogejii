But as that sounds like a lot of effort and I’m on a deadline, all I can do is simply give it my best shot.</p><p data-characters=711 data-current-count=1007 data-injectable=true>First, let’s set the scene: Cassie Webb is a paramedic, whose whole career is about saving people yet her one personality trait seems to be that she dislikes everyone. When she briefly dies after falling from a bridge in a car (apparently it’s a contractual requirement that every Spider-Man movie must feature a scene like this), she is reborn with psychic powers which she uses to protect three young women — Julia (Sydney Sweeney), Anya (Isabela Merced), and Mattie (Celeste O’Connor) — from being hunted down by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ezekiel Sims</a> (Tahar Rahim), alternatively known as Ceiling Man or Spider-Person. This is the Sony Spider-Man Universe, but god forbid they actually say the word Spider-Man.</p><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=257 data-injectable=false>By the grand third act, Cassie Stardust and the Spiders from Marvel confront Sims in a *checks notes* abandoned fireworks factory? (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Milhouse Van Houten, your day has come</a>). And here’s where things get interesting vaguely more intriguing even weirder.</p><h2 id=h-how-does-cassie-webb-defeat-ezekiel-sims data-injectable=false>How does Cassie Webb defeat Ezekiel Sims?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ezekiel-sims-madame-web-2.jpg><p data-characters=611 data-current-count=611 data-injectable=true>Sims gets the better of the Spider-Women and leaves all three in deathly danger, taunting Cassie that she can’t save them all. At this point, Cassie decides to pull a handy new power out of her hat and astral projects herself x3 in order to save her friends (Doctor Strange’s lawyers will be in touch). Apparently having mastered her powers in an instant, Cassie enters the Boss Fight with Sims and tells him the truth of his vision. Although he had foreseen his death in 10 years’ time at the hands of Julia, Anya, and Mattie, Cassie tells him it was always her who was destined to kill him.</p><p data-characters=689 data-current-count=689 data-injectable=true>With that, Cassie causes Sims to fall from a great height, whereupon he is crushed by a giant ‘S’ and ‘P’ from a crashing ‘PEPSI’ sign, which is such a bare-faced blend of shameless product placement and heavy-handed SPider-Man foreshadowing that it almost deserves applause. Unfortunately, a firework then proceeds to go off in Cassie’s face and she falls into the water for the THIRD TIME IN A SINGLE FILM. Her friends pull her out, though, and in a painfully prosaic pay-off for a scene earlier on when she taught them all CPR, they succeed in bringing her back to life. Still, the explosion from the firework has left her blind and paralyzed.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Does Spider-Man appear in Madame Web?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/adam-scott-madame-web-1-1.png><p data-characters=496 data-current-count=796 data-injectable=true>In the same hospital where Cassie recovers from her injuries, Mary Parker (Emma Roberts, in a role that requires her to smile and act pregnant and nothing else) gives birth to a baby boy. A baby boy who goes unnamed, but given his mother’s surname, the presence of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Adam Scott’s Ben as his uncle</a>, and a beautifully understated shot of some web-like mesh hanging over the bed, we can probably guess who he is. Yes, Spider-Man doesn’t turn up in Madame Web, but Peter Parker does.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How do the Spider-Women become superheroes?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/chrome_2023-11-16_15-02-05-1.jpg><p data-characters=559 data-current-count=859 data-injectable=true>The final scene sees Cassie unlocking her comic book look, now wearing red sunglasses and in a wheelchair, having seemingly adopted the girls as her own. What the film curiously makes no attempt to explain is how exactly the not-so-fantastic four eventually become the Spider-Women of Sims’ vision of the future. The film ends with another flashforward, in which all four are depicted in fancy CG superhero suits and possessing special powers — Julia can shoot glowy spider-webs, Anya has super-agility, and Celeste has an Iron Spider-like tech-suit.</p><p data-characters=132 data-current-count=132 data-injectable=false>In essence, then, Madame Web creates a whole new paradigm of comic book movie — it’s an origins story for an origins story.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Which Spider-Man timeline is Madame Web set in?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Andrew-Garfield-Spider-Man-Madame-Web.jpg><p data-characters=629 data-current-count=629 data-injectable=false>You may also be wondering which Spider-Man Baby Peter grows into. Well, the film does its best to avoid overtly stating its setting, but it’s been confirmed that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Madame Web was supposed to take place in 2003</a>. Needless to say, this makes Baby Peter far too young to be either Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield. Crucially, though, he’s also too young to be Tom Holland’s Spidey, who was canonically born in 2001. So we have literally just witnessed the birth of a brand new Spider-Man. With <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Madame Web 2 as unlikely</a> as Cassie Webb displaying any human emotion, however, we probably won’t see him ever again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJopJqckaKybsPEm2SeppSeu6h5xLGnpZmZo7KleceeqZ6rXZ28uHnIrWScp56jsqTA0marqGWknbJuv8%2Bim56qXaKur3nUp6CvnaKosnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jason-bateman-wants-his-new-netflix-series-to-be-as-popular-as-ozark.html><span>←</span><span>Jason Bateman wants his new Netflix series to be as popular as Ozark</span></a>
