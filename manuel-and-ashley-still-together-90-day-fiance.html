After meeting in Ecuador and getting engaged, the show takes a look into their relationship and whether or not they will go through with marriage.</p><p>However, with major disagreements and Manuel's alleged secret intentions exposed by Ashley, are the couple still together — or did they call it quits? Here's what we know about their romantic status.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, are Manuel and Ashley from '90 Day Fiancé' still together?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>In <a href=#>Season 10</a> Episode 2, Manuel leaves Ecuador and arrives in America to be with Ashley. While they have an emotional reunion at the airport complete with Ashley crying upon seeing him, their first night back together takes a wrong turn.</p><p>Because of his opinions on Ashley's witchcraft, and his dislike for her dog, the couple have a lot of obstacles that they have to get through before marriage. But, as of now, the two seem to want to work things out and be patient with each other.</p><p>That's not the end of the story, however.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ashley is suspicious of their relationship now that Manuel is in the U.S.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by 90 Day Fiance (@90dayfiance)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Now that Manuel is in America and the long-distance aspect of their relationship is gone, Ashley is starting to be a bit skeptical of Manuel's intentions.</p><p>In Episode 4, she has a conversation with her sister and shares that Manuel actually has family members in America. She believes there's a chance he only wants to marry her so that he can be with his family.</p><p>To make matters worse, Ashley further explains that while he was staying in Ecuador and they were long-distance, she never received any communication from his side of the family. So, to have that now that he is in America, she is wondering if she was just a pawn for him to get to his family and his feelings for her aren't real.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ashley might have already spoiled the ending of Season 10.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by 𝐀𝐬𝐡𝐥𝐞𝐲 𝐌𝐢𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐞👽 𝒯𝒶𝓇𝑜𝓉✨𝒜𝓈𝓉𝓇𝑜𝓁𝑜𝑔𝓎✨𝒜𝓀𝒶𝓈𝒽𝒾𝒸 𝑅𝑒𝒸𝑜𝓇𝒹𝓈✨𝒮𝒽𝒶𝒹𝑜𝓌 𝒲𝑜𝓇k (@ashleymichelle_90day)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Not even a few episodes into Season 10, Ashley already revealed on her social media that she is still in a relationship with Manuel after filming the series.</p><p>In October 2023, she uploaded a picture of the couple <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on her Instagram</a> with the caption "my Scorpio King." In the photo, Ashley revealed her left hand but not her ring finger, so it's unclear whether they did tie the knot, or if he's just there to visit.</p><p>But, the fact that he's in the photo with her and his temporary visa only lasted for 90 days unless they got married, is a pretty good sign that they took the next step in their relationship.</p><p>Watch 90 Day Fiancé on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6vwcSlZJqmlGKutLTLnrBmq6Seua1506ienqyYmr9uhY9mm5qxXZu2orrCng%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-was-walter-mondales-daughter-eleanor-mondale.html><span>←</span><span>Who was Walter Mondales daughter Eleanor Mondale?</span></a>
