She put Huck in the trunk. But he’s still alive! He wakes up inside a car trunk with Jennifer’s dead body right beside him. Meg is a SAVAGE. She pushes the car off a cliff — with Huck inside — and it plunges underwater. WHAT THE HUCK?!</p><h3><a href=#>See More Pics Of ‘Scandal’ Season 6</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-3>Jake comes to OPA to ask about Jennifer Fields. No one’s heard a word from Huck. Quinn is already suspicious of Meg. Olivia demands the team bring Huck back — alive. Quinn and Charlie go to the hotel room to look for clues. When they start looking for blood in the room, they find it everywhere. Blood is&nbsp;all over the place. Charlie already suspects the worst, but Quinn refuses to accept that idea.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Olivia goes to see Abby to tell her about Huck and brings along a picture of the mystery man and woman who have Abby under their thumb. Olivia needs Abby’s help to get high-level security clearance. She doesn’t have a good relationship with Fitz’s “girlfriend.” Dang, Olivia can barely get the word out of her mouth!</p><h3>Sink Or Swim</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>Huck fights like hell to get out of the trunk. He imagines he’s back at OPA and the gang’s trying to help him get out. Olivia, Quinn, and Charlie&nbsp;are there for him when he needs them, even in spirit. They’re his family. He gets out of the trunk, but the doors are locked! He has to wait until the car is fully submerged to make his move, but the door is blocked by a lock. FML.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Rowan shows up in his hallucination to give him a pep talk in the most Rowan way possible. Meanwhile, Meg taunts him. Huck only has a few seconds left. He chooses to fight and swims to the surface.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Abby calls the mystery woman to ask about Huck. This beeyotch tells Abby that Huck is dead. Abby’s hit an all-time low and needs someone to lean on. She goes to Fitz in her moment of need. “You’re the only real friend I have,” she tells him.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Charlie and Quinn continue their search for Huck. Their first win? Finding Huck’s backup laptop. Marcus shows up to OPA and wants to help find Huck. Olivia doesn’t need him to do any of the nitty gritty work, so he just sits by her side. Huck’s struggle isn’t over yet. He’s fighting against himself now. There’s a 7:52 reference for all you longtime fans. Huck is adamant that the team will find him in time. He refuses to believe he’ll die alone.</p><h3>The Slaps Heard Around The World</h3><p id=content-paragraph-9>Abby stops by OPA and, boy, was it a bad idea. Olivia comes up to her and slaps her hard TWICE! She knows Abby’s involved, so she slaps her AGAIN and demands to know where Huck is. Unfortunately for Abby, she has no idea. Abby spills the beans about the deal she made and tries to make Olivia feel bad about turning a blind eye regarding Cyrus. Olivia has no time for her excuses. If Abby can’t help her find Huck, then she’s “worthless.” But Olivia refuses to let her leave. She warns Abby that if Huck is dead, Quinn is going to lose it. Olivia will gladly let Quinn destroy Abby. “You messed with the wrong Gladiator,” Olivia says as she walks away.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Meg’s almost ready to make a quick getaway, but she’s stopped by Quinn and Charlie. Quinn tortures Meg as she desperately tries to find out information about Huck. She’s gone full-on Crazy Quinn. She cuts off one of Meg’s fingers and destroys her face! Charlie just watches his fiancee literally go nuts.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>But Meg’s not done twisting the knife in. “No wonder Huck loved me instead of you,” she says to Quinn. That’s what makes Quinn snap and slit Meg’s throat! BYE MEG. Quinn goes back to OPA with her head down. Olivia is not happy their only lead is dead.</p><h3>Actions Speak Louder Than Words</h3><p id=content-paragraph-12>Charlie isn’t just going to stand by and let everyone give up, especially Olivia. She’s the leader, and the team needs her. “You have to do something for them,” Charlie says to Olivia. He knows she can “fix this” and “fix them.” All she has to do is that “Olivia Pope thing” she does. God, I love Charlie.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>“You can’t just give up,” he continues. “You are a miracle worker.” His speech works. Olivia rallies the team together. Jake and Olivia pinpoint Huck’s location with Jennifer’s phone. They’re able to find Huck and get him to the hospital. While the rest of the waited, Marcus let is slip&nbsp;that Abby is kind of responsible for all of this. Quinn lunges across the table ready to fight Abby. “I will kill you,” she seethes.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Everyone gathers at the hospital to await news about Huck’s condition. The doctor tells the team to prepare themselves for Huck not to wake up the same man or at all. Surprisingly, Fitz shows up to the hospital. He pulls Olivia aside for a little chat.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>He puts his hands on Olivia’s shoulders, melting my Olitz-loving heart. They hug and Olivia allows herself to just let go for a second with Fitz. He’s not just there for Olivia, though. Abby told him everything, and Fitz wants Olivia to forgive her. Olivia isn’t down for that. Fitz reminds Olivia that she forgave him and he forgave her. The Oval and the power that comes with it can make people do terrible things. Olivia’s the one who got out, and that’s why she’s the one who can get Abby through this. “She needs you,” Fitz adds.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Quinn sits by Huck’s bedside and talks to him while he fights for his life. She makes him all these promises, ones that she’ll make sure she fulfills if he wakes up. “I will never forgive you if you die,” Quinn says. She starts to walk away when she hears Huck take a breath! She crawls in bed with him just like Izzie did with Denny on Grey’s Anatomy. Meanwhile, Charlie is watching all of this go down from a distance. Poor guy.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Olivia goes outside to take a breather and ends up sitting beside a broken Abby. She places her hand over Abby’s in a moment of solidarity. They don’t say anything, but actions speak louder than words. Olivia will forgive Abby. One day.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what did you think of tonight’s episode of Scandal?
