Big Pokey song/ Man, I got the news last night when I was headed home/ On my way from Fayetteville, I had a show with Live Sosa/ In my bedroom I used to have the Hardest Pit poster.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Fliparachi then went on to praise Pokey for his mic skills and pen game while taking solace in the fact that he’s now reunited with fellow SUC stars DJ Screw and Big Moe, who died in 2000 and 2007 respectively.</p><p>“You was a fool with the flow, you was a fool with the pen,” he raps. “‘Keep My Name Out Yo Mouth,’ that was my favorite track by you/ Boys couldn’t keep up with you, Poke, it’s like they had a flat tyre/ ‘Cause down South, man, we be rollin’ on choppers/ Now you up there with Screw and Moe, now all of ya can watch us.”</p><p>Check out the track below:</p><p></p><p>Big Pokey (real name Milton Powell) passed away on Sunday (June 18) after collapsing on stage during a Juneteenth performance at Pour 09 Bar & Rooftop in Beaumont, Texas.</p><p>It’s not been revealed what caused the rapper to collapse during his set, but his family confirmed the news in a statement.</p><p>“It is with deep sadness that we share the news of the passing of our beloved Milton ‘Big Pokey’ Powell,” it began. “Big Pokey passed away on June 18, 2023. He was well loved by his family, his friends, and his loyal fans.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>The statement then went on to say that the family would release information about his “celebration of life” and how the public can pay their respects in the coming days, adding: “We ask that you respect his family and their privacy during this difficult time.”</p><p>Lil Flip among many others have since flooded social media to pay their respects to Big Pokey, who besides putting out his own music has featured on tracks alongside Lil Keke, Slim Thug, Mike Jones, Chamillionaire, Paul Wall and many others.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“I wasn’t ready for this,” <a href=# rel=noopener>Bun B wrote on Instagram</a> alongside a photograph of Big Pokey. “One of the most naturally talented artists in the city. Low key, humble mountain of a man who moved with honor and respect. He was easy to love and hard to hate.</p><p>“He’d pull up, do what he had to do and head home. One of the pillars of our city. If heart of gold was a person. Iconic member of the SUC. There will never be another and will be missed dearly. We love and honor you Sensei. Rest in heaven.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2020/03/51D26E7F-0DBC-420A-876D-7CA834C1463B-165x165.jpeg alt="Review: Lil Flip Upholds Hometown Hero Status With 'Leprechaun 2'" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> review</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Review: Lil Flip Upholds Hometown Hero Status With 'Leprechaun 2'</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>March 30, 2020</p></a><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Paul Wall shared a video of himself enjoying a Pokey performance</a>, writing: “It is with an extremely heavy heart that I make this post saying rest in peace to @sucbigpokey what a great mentor and friend.
