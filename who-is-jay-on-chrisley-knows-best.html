By the time Rascal Flatts was being formed in 1999, he was totally ready for the big leagues. Since the group started things up, they’ve released nine studio albums and have garnered massive respect. The reason they’re so highly revered is that 26 of their singles were able to reach the top 20 on the Billboard Hot Country song chart.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Rascal Flatts (@rascalflatts)</a></p></figure><p>Rascal Flatts has taken home numerous awards from Billboard, People's Choice, The Country Music Association, and more.</p><p>Some of Jay’s most memorable cameos in shows and movies aside from Chrisley Knows Best include CSI: Crime Scene investigation and Hannah Montana: The Movie.</p><p>It’s easy to understand his reported net worth knowing all of this about him.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jay DeMarcus (@jaydemarcus)</a></p><span>Source: instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What else does Jay DeMarcus have going on?</h2><p>Starring in random episodes of Chrisley Knows Best and getting together with his bandmates from Rascal Flatts are only two things of many that keep Jay Demarcus busy.
