The two quickly became close and developed a romantic connection, leading to a decade-long relationship.</p><p>Later, the couple eventually tied the knot in 2011 in a low-key ceremony at Bar Lurcat in Minneapolis, Stephanie’s home state. They also deliberately chose a single venue for both the ceremony and reception to simplify things for out-of-town guests.</p><p>During the wedding, the actor set only two <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">rules</a> for the celebration. The first rule was that everyone had to have fun, and the second was that Lance couldn’t see his wife’s wedding dress before she walked down the aisle.</p><p>Similarly, Stephanie embraced simplicity in her wedding preparations, allocating a modest $250 for her dress, which the actor personally picked up from the post office. She also chose floral arrangements for the dress details.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lance-Reddick-Wife.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Lance Reddick and his wife, Stephanie Reddick, were together for over two decades.
