Otherwise,&nbsp;all&nbsp;you're watching are grown men&nbsp;spit out cliché after cliché. Beyond the NBA culture&nbsp;that&nbsp;encourages cute sidekicks at the table, we&nbsp;see athletes&nbsp;from&nbsp;other sports share the spotlight with their children as well. Be it hockey, football, and even wrestling, the majority of athletes have their own families, and by extension children. It's often hard to picture some of these&nbsp;performers as parents, especially in the case of wrestling.&nbsp;Mankind aka Mick Foley is a father. You see where I'm coming from?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, as much as these moments can produce cuteness overload, sometimes they also come with awkwardness mixed with hilarity. Since the beginning of time, kids&nbsp;have said and done the darnedest things. And we are all better off because of it. Finding humour in the actions of the smallest and most innocent among us is not a difficult exercise, but rather an enjoyable one. Their parents entertain on the field or on the court, but these kids have a natural ability to make us laugh and remember that it's just a game.</p><p>Here are 15 funny/awkward/perplexing photos involving professional&nbsp;athletes (from all over the sporting landscape) with their children.</p><h2 id=dwyane-wade><span class=item-num>15 </span><span><strong>Dwyane Wade</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>First thing I noticed about this photo – swear on my life – the old-school trophies in the top right of the photo. I remember getting those as a child, had no clue that was still the go-to style for rec league hardware? – some things never change, I guess. Here we have the Wade Family – missing Gabrielle Union though so not sure why I'm still even looking at it. Anybody notice the cow pattern socks on the surprised kid? I want those. Wade and Union do not have any children together. During a brief split in 2013, Wade actually conceived his third child with a longtime friend of his. Doesn't need much time eh? They don't call him "Flash" for nothing...Wade and Union married in August 2014.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since marrying Mrs. Mike Lowry –&nbsp;Bad Boys II reference for those of you living under a rock – D-Wade's career has gone in the toilet. Okay, that was perhaps a bit harsh, but injuries and age have slowed him down. He never should've left Miami and it's good that he's back with the Heat, not only for him and his career but for the league as well. Coming off the bench, after returning to Miami via Cleveland, Wade's play helped Miami qualify for the playoffs, though they ultimately lost&nbsp;to the 76ers in five games.</p><h2 id=demar-derozan><span class=item-num>14 </span><span><strong>DeMar DeRozan</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>DeMar DeRozan has been at the forefront of the Toronto Raptors rise to NBA prominence over the last five years. Upon becoming regular playoff participants, the world got a closer look at his adorable daughter, Diar. Born in 2013, Diar routinely accompanied her father to his post-game press conferences, pulling stunts such as faking to pick his nose, pretending to fall asleep and even saying a few words of her own from time to time. It's funny, some media members don't like kids at the podium, saying it affects how their ability to do their jobs – you mean your job of asking horrible cliché questions? Children present&nbsp;inject some humour and fun into what otherwise is a lifeless mundane event.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong class=punchline-small>Now, anybody who knows DeRozan and the Raptors obviously is familiar with their playoff struggles.</strong></p><p>Hence why the above photo was clearly taken following a loss. History would suggest that to be the case, but it's also pretty clear&nbsp;by DeMar's face that his team didn't do too well. Win or lose, DeMar has Diar. It's easy to forget these players, whom we relentlessly critique and expect them to deliver titles we consider our own, have families.&nbsp;Play some defense next season, DeMar!</p><h2 id=serena-williams><span class=item-num>13 </span><span><strong>Serena Williams</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Queen of Tennis, Serena Williams, welcomed her first child Alexis in 2017. Due to complications, Williams had to have a C-section. She <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claims to have been devastated</a> at first about not being able to deliver naturally. In addition to winning every tennis tournament she enters,&nbsp;Serena Williams does a lot of winning off the court. Writing books, TV cameos, hell, she speaks like 17 languages.&nbsp;I consider it a busy day if I have to go to the grocery store. Did you know that Williams won the Australian Open in 2017 while&nbsp;she was approximately eight weeks pregnant? Unbelievable.</p><p>Is it just me, or does she and little Alexis&nbsp;appear to be a tad, you know,&nbsp;<strong>high</strong>, in the above photo? Obviously, they are not high! But those eyes... Williams continues to work her way back into championship form. She has pulled out of several tournaments ahead of the upcoming French Open major. She does plan on playing in the clay season's most prized tournament, even if she's still feeling less than 100 percent. Serena, at&nbsp;75 percent, is still going to win more than she loses. And if she needs some divine intervention,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she will certainly look to Jehovah</a>. Imagine seeing Serena singing at the end of your driveway?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tiger-woods><span class=item-num>12 </span><span><strong>Tiger Woods</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Well doesn't this look like a fun-filled Woods Family outing? – did Tiger give them some muscle relaxants before first-serve? Okay, enough! I'm a Tiger Woods fan and am happy to see him back on tour contending in tournaments again. He makes golf more exciting...I believe that to be an objectively true statement. You may not like him as a person or even a golfer, but&nbsp;a contending Tiger increases the entertainment value of any tournament. Now, Woods' family&nbsp;drama has been well documented so I won't go into great detail here. Most importantly, it seems all parties involved have moved on and in the case of Tiger himself, are&nbsp;finally&nbsp;back to normal – or as normal as things can be following such a roller-coaster sequence of events.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Getting back to the mood of the photo – is this like a first-round snoozefest, or what? Why do none of them look the least bit entertained? It's like they're watching a Tiger-less golf tournament&nbsp;(zinggg!). Being good friends with Roger Federer, you'd think Woods could've gotten better tickets to a better show. Is Tiger hurting for money? I&nbsp;highly doubt that, as&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Woods&nbsp;made a reported $37.1 million</a>. In 2017, despite earning just $107,000 in prize money, from endorsements. He doing fine...</p><h2 id=brent-burns><span class=item-num>11 </span><span><strong>Brent Burns</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I honestly don't know who's who... Brent Burns has carved out a reputation for being...how do I say it? – a first-class beauty. Whether you're a Sharks fan or not, it's pretty hard to not cheer for this guy, on and off the ice. Dude looks as though he just likes having fun. This photo was taken during a family trip to Disneyworld that reportedly involved Burns being mistaken for a pirate, and many other photo requests for that matter. Is that beard something else, eh?</p><p>Two kids with his wife, Susan (who I've mentioned before in a previous post about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">some lucky guys who may have outkicked their coverage</a>), hairy Brent spends his offseason in Barrie, Ontario as well as in the state of Minnesota. Known for a widespread affection for animals, Burns actually has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a house in Saint Paul known as 'Burns' Zoo'</a>. Trying to bring back what Chewbacca started, I applaud Brent Burns' efforts to reduce the cyclical stigma associated with facial hair. Now he may be taking it a little far. Then again, anything worth doing in life is worth overdoing, no?&nbsp;That is one tall Chewbacca – Burns is six foot five and that furry Wookiee is a substantial chunk abovehim.&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lebron-james><span class=item-num>10 </span><span><strong>LeBron James</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Is LeBron hosting a spelling bee between two of his kids? I'm taking the older one on the right, both look confident don't get me wrong, but I just think experience trumps all. Unless, of course, we're talking about the Boston-Cleveland series happening right now...James and his experienced Cavaliers are getting dominated by a younger, hungrier Celtics team. That brings me back to this photo – LeBron is actually a participant in the spelling bee. He's the most experienced speller up there. However, as someone who's likely grown up with the crutch of spell check and auto-correct, I feel as though his spelling on the spot skills have eroded over the years. Still going with the kid on the right!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By now, you probably think I'm crazy, so let's talk about LeBron's basketball career. Where do I start?! Three-time NBA champion, four-time MVP, three-time Finals MVP, 14-time All-Star, 7th all-time in points scored (and climbing fast!), the list goes on and on... to some, James, and not Michael Jordan is the greatest player to ever step on a basketball court. That should be a good&nbsp;debate for another time – LeBron and Michael are both generational basketball players and brilliant businessmen as well. But here's a question – I wonder who the better speller is?</p><h2 id=carey-price-missing><span class=item-num>9 </span><span><strong>Carey Price (Missing)</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Does anybody know where my dad is? He just left me in these ginormous block looking things...somebody please go find my dad, 'cause I just pooped and&nbsp;now need a new diaper&nbsp;(I imagine that's what is going through Liv Price's head in the above.)&nbsp;Carey Price and his wife, Angela Webber, have one daughter, Liv. If you follow Mama Price on Instagram, I'm sure you're familiar with Liv, who makes frequent appearances on her mother's social accounts.</p><p><strong class=punchline-small>Liv even has an all-star appearance on her young resume, with Price bringing her out during a recent skills competition.</strong></p><p>Basketball culture has obviously begun rubbing off on other sports. Baseball has seen kids be featured in the Home Run Derby for years. Essentially the gimmick shows, it makes sense to relax the rules and allow players to share these moments with their families. Carey Price will be looking for a bounce-back year next season. He was bad this year, as was his team. The Montreal hockey market does not react well to sustained bouts with on-ice ineptitude.&nbsp;I'm sure if you ask Price, he'll tell you that winning is obviously the preferred result, but regardless of what happens, nothing beats a post-game hug from his biggest fan...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=patrick-marleau><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><strong>Patrick Marleau</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>They grow up so fast, don't they? – Patrick Marleau signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs to bring a veteran presence to a young dressing room. In the process, he decided to adopt two of the Maple Leafs' youngest and most promising talents, Mitch Marner and Auston Matthews, bringing his child count to six by the looks of it.&nbsp;Lucky he's making the big bucks otherwise feeding all those animals would be challenging...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Maple Leafs have one of the league's youngest teams in the NHL – in saying that they also possess the most promise of any franchise out there. With young dynamic&nbsp;players&nbsp;such as Matthews, Marner, William Nylander, Morgan Rielly,&nbsp;along with Frederick Anderson in net, Toronto is set up to have sustained success for years. This season's playoff loss to Boston was a tough pill to swallow, but most hockey experts predict Toronto will have numerous other opportunities in the years to come. Marleau, meanwhile, is getting older and likely coming to the end of what has been an excellent career. Clearly, he's enjoying his new team and teammates. Whether his experience, coupled with their impressive talent and youthful exuberance is enough to get Marleau his first Stanley Cup remains to be seen...</p><h2 id=drew-brees><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><strong>Drew Brees</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since joining the New Orleans Saints in 2006, Drew Brees has started all but two games. I'd say that qualifies for Iron Man consideration. And despite having to commit countless hours to gameplan for opponents, the future Hall of Fame quarterback still finds time to go trick-or-treating.&nbsp;If only his kid was as excited as Drew was...&nbsp;Brees recently re-signed with the Saints, which was to be expected. He's been such an important figure, not only for the team, but the city as well. His arrival came a year&nbsp;after the devastation&nbsp;from Hurricane Katrina. Five years following the disastrous events, Brees and the Saints won the Super Bowl, dedicating the victory to the city. Hard to leave a place when you have that type of connection to the fan base, and people in general.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether he can lead them to another one before calling it a career – they fell victim to the Minneapolis Miracle a season ago, losing to the Vikings on the final play of the game. A defeat such as that is not easy to come back from. But if there's any leader in that league capable of rallying the troops for another run, it's Drew Brees.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kyle-lowry><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><strong>Kyle Lowry</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Kyle Lowry is DeMar DeRozan's brother from another mother. The two have developed quite the bromance during their time in Toronto. One thing they do share is fatherhood – Lowry with two boys and DeRozan with two girls. If you don't think those kids are gonna be paired up by their two fathers, you're wrong. Kyle and DeMar are attached at the hip so you can bet they will try something down the road. How sassy do both those kids look? Much like DeMar, Kyle has been critical in Toronto's turnaround, arriving in 2012. The six seasons since coming to Toronto have been the greatest in franchise history, essentially.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong class=punchline-small>Despite the playoff failures, Lowry has been a great Raptor and will certainly go down as one of the most beloved players in the organization's history.</strong></p><p>And to think he was almost traded to the New York Knicks all those years ago? It was a move that fell through when Knicks owner James Dolan shut it down. It was supposed to trigger a rebuild – instead, Toronto fans have gotten to see remarkable regular season results year in and year out. The playoffs have been another story, but that trade could've drastically altered the respective courses of both franchises.</p><h2 id=peyton-manning><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>Peyton Manning</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Why is&nbsp;Ted in a Manning Family photo? He doesn't own Papa John's anymore, you high-as-a-kite teddy bear! Where's Mark Wahlberg when you need him? Peyton Manning, the owner of the world's biggest forehead, was enjoying a relaxing round of golf at a charity event when he and his family were accosted by this creepy bear. The good sport Manning is, he gave the bear the photo he desired – but that wasn't enough apparently as the bear proceeded to follow them around the whole course. Or so I heard...</p><p>Manning, finally retired from football, seems destined for the broadcast booth (or coaching if he's interested). His mind is a football encyclopedia. No other player studied the game to the level Peyton Manning did. It was possible to outplay him, but one never expected to out think, or out prepare Peyton Manning. When you play as long as he did, you see everything. By the end of his career – and for several years&nbsp;before – Manning had seen everything there was to see on a football field. The master of pre-snap action, he would drive defenses crazy with his shenanigans: waving his hands, tapping his helmet and of course, frantically yelling&nbsp;OMAHA! OMAHA!&nbsp;Turns out, the majority of the time none of it meant anything. Though, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Manning did eventually spill the beans on Omaha</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=steph-curry><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>Steph Curry</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Riley Curry might be the queen of the podium children – <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">check her out</a>.&nbsp;Chef Curry's&nbsp;daughter is not afraid of the spotlight, routinely interacting with media members and just blabbing out whatever she pleases. Some of us march to the beat of our own drum, and nothing else. Riley subscribes to that style of thinking.&nbsp;Respect. Her father, meanwhile,&nbsp;is transforming the game of basketball. He's slithery yet small. His lack of size might hurt him at times, but it hasn't stopped him from already becoming the game's greatest shooter of all time. Better than Bird, Miller, or Allen – Steph Curry has no equal shooting a basketball.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And his daughter may not have an equal, either. Riley hasn't been seen as much these playoffs – I wonder if the party poopers who don't like kids are finally convincing the powers that be... I hope not. My guess is Riley, being&nbsp;a big money attraction now, is saving herself for the finals. She ain't about to grace us with her presence every night, after a conference final game. These games are for opening acts, not main acts like RC clearly is at this point. Three more Warrior wins and I think she starts making more frequent appearances.</p><h2 id=derrick-rose><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>Derrick Rose</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That face you make they say you're washed up and finished...Derrick Rose's son has heard enough of the criticism thrown at his once-upon-a-time MVP father. Another example of why anybody cold to the idea of having these entertaining children at the podium needs to be reassigned – I want a player to send their kid (older) up there to answer questions one time... by themselves.&nbsp;Yeah, hi, I'll be speaking on behalf of my father this evening. He's prepared me for all your predictable pokes and I look forward to giving you all you need to produce your juicy stories tomorrow: about how our team is finished, our rotations are wrong and how I myself need to be better... bring it, media!</p><p>Back in Minnesota, reunited with&nbsp;Tom Thibodeau, Rose looked a little more like his former self – before injuries ravaged his lower half. Being in a situation where he can ease his way back and not have to play the&nbsp;main role might be exactly what Rose needs. Something wasn't right in Cleveland – not sure what went on there actually? Years ago, this guy was unstoppable – a blur on the court – scoring at will and making plays few are capable of. Some guys just have bad luck with injuries, and Derrick Rose certainly qualifies as one of those unfortunate souls.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=luke-harper><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><strong>Luke Harper</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>First off, YES – Luke Harper is an athlete. Don't fight it... Harper, who today makes up half of The Bludgeon Brothers tag team, alongside Erick Rowan, has since lost his first name (as has Rowan) as part of the new gimmick. He's been wrestling in the WWE since 2012, with his first big story arc coming as a member of The Wyatt Family. Before WWE, Harper wrestled on the independent circuit under the name Brodie Lee. He's performed all over the world, including in Japan for Dragon Gate. Presently, he is the only wrestler in WWE history to win the tag-team titles as a member of both NXT and WWE's main show roster.</p><p><strong class=punchline-small>Outside of the squared circle, Harper has two children.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He also appears to be a Washington Redskins fan. Actually, he's a huge Redskins fan. Heading into the 2016-17 season, he, as part of a CBS feature, previewed the team's outlook. From opinions surrounding Robert Griffin III, to how he felt about how the team handled Kirk Cousins, Harper seems to be a serious fan of pigskin gladiators. Judging by the above photo, his son (who happens to be named Brodie) will be too – and I doubt he'll have much say in who he gets to cheer for. Let's all hope for the kid's sake that Washington rights their ship in the years to come. They have been disappointing the last few seasons and are relying on Alex Smith (perennial playoff choker) to bring them to the promised land. Best pray to Sister Abigail...</p><h2 id=roman-reigns><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>Roman Reigns</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What is Roman Reigns? I've long wondered what his best angle would be. I feel as though it's always the opposite of what the story's intention is – crowds cheer him when they're supposed to hate him and vice versa. Having feuded with the likes of Brock Lesnar and Braun Strowman, Reigns has taken his fair share of bumps – Reigns has been dummied so many times, looking back at it... The above photo was likely snapped during one of Reigns' recovery stints – one often needs bottomless tea with their child after being slammed by twelve F-5s. Who am I kidding...? – this picture is adorable. But you can easily make it hilarious if you simply imagine what led to the moment being captured. And that's what I did with my F-5 take...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reigns is a polarizing figure in the WWE, fans split on their allegiances to him.
