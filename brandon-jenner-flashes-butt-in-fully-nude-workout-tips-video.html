I’ve never done a workout tip video,” Jenner, 38, said in <a href=#>the Instagram video</a> on Monday, March 23, strategically showing just his bare abs. “But I wanted to show you a couple of really cool things I’ve learned about pullups.”</p><p>The Princes of Malibu alum added, “[With] monkey grips, really get your hands over. The other thing is tighten your glutes so it straightens your back. I’ll show you what I mean!”</p><p>Jenner then proceeded to face away from the camera and hop up on a bar, where he began to do a series of pull-ups. As he demonstrated the exercise, he flashed his bare butt, revealing that he was fully nude all along.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Brandon-Jenner-Goes-Fully-Nude-to-Provide-Workout-Tips-in-New-Video-02.jpg><p>The “Death of Me” crooner referenced the naked moment in his Instagram Stories, where he promoted his cover of <a href=#><strong>Sam Smith</strong></a>’s “Too Good at Goodbyes” on Tuesday, March 24.
