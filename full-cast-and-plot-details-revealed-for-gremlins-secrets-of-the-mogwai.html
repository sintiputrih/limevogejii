In 1990, a sequel film called&nbsp;Gremlins 2: The New Batch&nbsp;hit theaters. A third film has been long-rumored. However, there is no information or timeline for the project at the current time. In an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">interview with Comicbook</a>, Chris Columbus said, “I can only say we’re working on it. We’re working toward that goal, but we haven’t gotten there yet.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ynwculZJyZo6l6orrDZqelp6RisabAwKKjrGWimsOmrcuem2aen6d6qL7EpqOipqNiwKav0Z6rrGWfm3q1tMRmpKifp5a2cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./edith-gonz-lez.html><span>←</span><span>Edith Gonzlez</span></a>
