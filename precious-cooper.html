Introduction Nobody would ever question Precious Cooper’s status as Queen of the Streets.
The Street Outlaws: Memphis street racing celebrity is renowned for her ability to drive any vehicle straight off the trailer.
A petrol-head since her teens, Precious is accustomed to the fast-paced, high-octane world of street racing.
As one of the original cast members of Street Outlaws Originals, she’s also become accustomed to the world of reality television—and knows how to milk it for all it’s worth."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
