His pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation remain entirely normal, on room air,” O’Connor wrote. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The physician said that Biden is tolerating the antiviral Paxlovid “well” and that he would continue the course as planned.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>O’Connor said Biden would continue to drink water, take Tylenol and use his inhaler as needed. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The letter is the first update from Biden’s physician since Thursday morning, when he wrote a letter detailing the president’s symptoms and treatment after he tested positive for COVID-19. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The national security angle</strong>: White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters Friday that Biden’s COVID-19 diagnosis has had “no impact whatsoever” on the national security decision-making process, noting that the president joined a regular call with his national security team on Friday morning. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Read more here</a>.&nbsp;</p><a href=# class=thehill-promo-link__link rel=noopener><br>Raskin says he’s ‘impatient’ with pace of DOJ’s Jan. 6 investigation</a><br><a href=# class=thehill-promo-link__link rel=noopener><br>On The Money — Ukraine, Russia strike grain deal</a><br><h2>Klobuchar concerned over One Medical acquisition</h2><p>Sen. <strong>Amy Klobuchar</strong>, a fierce critic of Amazon’s market power, is urging the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate the e-commerce giant’s proposed $3.9 billion acquisition of primary health care provider One Medical.&nbsp;</p><p>The Minnesota Democrat, chair of the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, asked the FTC in a letter Thursday to investigate the deal over concerns she said it raises about anti-competitive behavior in the pharmaceutical industry and sensitive data it would allow the company to accumulate.&nbsp;</p><p>“<a href=#>This proposed transaction</a>&nbsp;raises questions about potential anticompetitive effects related to the pharmacy services business Amazon already owns and about preferencing vendors who offer other services through Amazon,” Klobuchar wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>“I also ask that the FTC consider the role of data, including as a potential barrier to entry, given that this proposed deal could result in the accumulation of highly sensitive personal health data in the hands of an already data-intensive company,” she added.&nbsp;</p><p>The American Economic Liberties Project has pushed for regulators to block Amazon’s One Medical Acquisition, calling it dangerous.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Allowing Amazon to control the health care data for another 700,000+ individuals is terrifying,” Krista Brown, a senior policy analyst at the American Economic Liberties Project, said in a statement.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Read more here</a>.&nbsp;</p><a href=# class=thehill-promo-link__link rel=noopener><br>Raskin says he’s ‘impatient’ with pace of DOJ’s Jan. 6 investigation</a><br><a href=# class=thehill-promo-link__link rel=noopener><br>On The Money — Ukraine, Russia strike grain deal</a><br><p><strong>JUDGE EXTENDS ORDER BLOCKING KENTUCKY ABORTION BAN&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A Kentucky order blocking an abortion ban was extended Friday, preventing a “trigger” law from taking effect and keeping the procedure legal in the state.&nbsp;</p><p>The trigger law&nbsp;<a href=#>went into effect</a>&nbsp;after the recent U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last month. But Kentucky’s Jefferson Circuit Court Judge Mitch Perry suspended the ban with&nbsp;<a href=#>a June 30 temporary order</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Perry extended that order with a temporary injunction Friday.&nbsp;</p><p>The injunction will prevent enforcement of a ban that would criminalize almost all abortions in the state, and comes after a&nbsp;<a href=#>challenge</a>&nbsp;from Kentucky abortion-rights groups contending that the state constitution protects the right to the procedure.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Read more here.</a></p><a href=# class=thehill-promo-link__link rel=noopener><br>Raskin says he’s ‘impatient’ with pace of DOJ’s Jan. 6 investigation</a><br><a href=# class=thehill-promo-link__link rel=noopener><br>On The Money — Ukraine, Russia strike grain deal</a><br><p><strong>LA POISED TO IMPOSE NEW INDOOR MASK RULES</strong></p><p>Most places in the U.S. do not have mask mandates, but Los Angeles could soon be an exception.&nbsp;</p><p>The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is expected to instate an indoor mask mandate as early as next week, in response to rising COVID-19 case counts and hospitalizations in the area.&nbsp;</p><p>County officials have said they’d reinstate the indoor mask rules if the county stays under “high” levels for two weeks. To reach the “high” category, the county’s rate<br>of daily COVID-positive patients admitted to area hospitals would top 10 per<br>100,000 residents.&nbsp;</p><p>LA County&nbsp;<a href=#>lifted outdoor mask rules</a>&nbsp;in February and&nbsp;<a href=#>got rid of the indoor mandate</a>&nbsp;in March.&nbsp;<a href=#>Reinstating the indoor mandate</a>&nbsp;in the nation’s most populous county would impact 10 million residents.&nbsp;</p><p>Under a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) metric measuring COVID-19 in a community, LA County is currently&nbsp;<a href=#>flagged as “high” risk</a>, and the CDC recommends indoor masking in public to match these elevated case levels.
