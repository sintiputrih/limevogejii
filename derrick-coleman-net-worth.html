Coleman was born on the 21st June 1967, in Mobile, Alabama USA, and is a retired professional basketball player, who spent 17 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA), playing for such teams as New Jersey Nets (1990-1995), Philadelphia 76ers (1995-1999, and again from 2001 until 2004), and Detroit Pistons (2004-2006). His career started in 1990 end ended in 2006.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Derrick Coleman is, as of early 2017? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Coleman’s net worth is as high as $45 million, an amount earned largely through his successful career as basketball player.</p><h3>Derrick Coleman Net Worth $45 Million</h3><p>Although born in Mobile, Derrick grew up in Detroit, Michigan, where he went to high school, where he began playing competitive basketball, becoming one of the best players in his class. After matriculation, he enrolled at Syracuse University, where he continued to play basketball, having a successful career, and earning several prestigious awards and honors, including being named Second-team All-American- UPI in 1989, Third-team All-American- NABC in 1989, then Consensus first-team All-American (1990), and Big East Player of the Year award in 1990, while also being selected for the First-team All-Big East, three times, consecutively from 1988 until 1990.</p><p>After successful college career, Derrick was drafted from the first position by the New Jersey Nets, who were coached by Chuck Daly, and led by such players as Chris Dudley, Dražen Petrović, <a href=#>Sam Bowie</a> and <a href=#>Kenny Anderson</a> of the young and up-coming stars. In his first season, Derrick assumed the role of the team leader and averaged a double-double per game with 18.4 points and 10.3 rebounds, which won him the Rookie of the Year award. He improved even more in his second and third seasons, helping the Nets reach the play-offs, but that was all he could do for the team. Thanks to his great games, Derrick earned a place in the All-Star games in 1993 and 1994, and a spot in the All-NBA Third Team. He stayed in New Jersey until 1995, when he was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers with Sean Higgins and Rex Walters, for <a href=#>Shawn Bradley</a>,<a href=#> Tim Perry</a> and Greg Graham. However, he couldn’t find his game in Philadelphia, which resulted in lower statistics, while he also had injury problems. After his contract expired in 1999, he joined the Charlotte Hornets as a free agent, but after only three unconvincing seasons, he was traded back to the 76ers.</p><p>Derrick bounced back with 15.1 points, and 8.8 rebounds per game in 58 starts, however, his injuries returned and his numbers declined again, averaging under 10.0 points for two seasons, before being traded to the Detroit Pistons. While being a part of the Pistons he participated in the infamous Pacers-Pistons brawl in 2004, for which he suffered suspension. His career ended in a disastrous way, as he was released by the Pistons.</p><p>Nevertheless, he will be remembered for his game with averaging at least 20 points, 10 rebounds, five assists, five steals, and five blocks, becoming second to achieve such statistics, after <a href=#>Hakeem Olajuwon</a> and before <a href=#>Draymond Green</a>.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Derrick has been married to Gina since 1996, and they currently live in Detroit Michigan,. Back in 2014 he helped the citizens of Flint, Michigan during the water crisis by driving 65 miles per day to bring them clean bottled water.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=5.3577981651376><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$45 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>June 21, 1967</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Mobile, Alabama, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>2.08 m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>100 kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Basketball player</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>University of California, Los Angeles</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Gina Coleman</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Derrick Coleman Jr.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Derrick Coleman Sr., May Evans</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3259129/</a></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=1.5><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Good Morning America</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>From Glory Days</td><td>2012</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Guest</td></tr><tr><td>30 for 30</td><td>2010</td><td>TV Series documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Bill Nye, the Science Guy</td><td>1995</td><td>TV Series documentary</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1994 NBA All-Star Game</td><td>1994</td><td>TV Special</td><td>Himself</td></tr></table><h3>Known for movies</h3><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjp2cq6qZmLhur86lnKaZnmK7psCMsKarrJhk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./danai-gurira-height-wiki-biography-age-boyfriend-net-worth-html.html><span>←</span><span>Danai Gurira Height, Wiki, Biography, Age, Boyfriend, Net Worth</span></a>
