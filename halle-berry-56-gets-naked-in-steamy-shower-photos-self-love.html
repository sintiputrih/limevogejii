The second pic shows the former model from a further angle, while she still has her arms covering her front and her smartphone camera blocking her face.</p><p>In both pictures, Berry proudly displays her naturally curly hair and makeup-free face. The only accessory she donned were a couple of gold rings.</p><p>Her followers flocked to the comments to gush about how the <a href=#>Oscar</a> winner looked. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do that to us Ms. Berry,‚Äù one user wrote. While another joked that the actress should ‚Äúmove her arms.‚Äù</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Halle-Berry-1.jpg><p>The Moonfall star recently made an appearance at the 95th annual Academy Awards alongside her boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Van Hunt</strong></a> ‚Äî whom she began dating in August 2020.</p><p>While getting ready for Hollywood‚Äôs biggest night, Berry gave a behind-the-scenes look at the process <a href=#>in a video</a> shared on her respective social media. In the clip, she was seemingly topless as the camera angled to only show off her face and the upper part of her torso. Michael Bubl√©‚Äôs song ‚ÄúFeeling Good‚Äù played in the background.</p><p>‚Äúguess who‚Äôs going to the ball tomorrow,‚Äù she wrote via Instagram at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Halle-Berry-2.jpg><p>Berry went on to present the award for Best Actress that evening, which <a href=#><strong>Michelle Yeoh</strong> </a>took home for Everything Everywhere All at Once. Both actresses are the only two <a href=#>women of color to receive the award</a> in 95 years. The Monster Ball actress won the coveted award in 2002 and gave a moving speech when she accepted the prize.</p><p>‚ÄúThis moment is so much bigger than me,‚Äù she told the audience at the time. ‚ÄúThis moment is for Dorothy Dandridge, Lena Horne, Diahann Carroll. It‚Äôs for the women that stand beside me: <a href=#><strong>Jada Pinkett</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Angela Bassett</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Vivica Fox</strong></a>. And it‚Äôs for every nameless, faceless woman of color that now has a chance because this door tonight has been opened.‚Äù</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Berry opened up about her historical win 15 years later when the Oscars received backlash for their lack of diversity over the years.</p><p>‚ÄúI sat there and I really thought, ‚ÄòWow, that moment really meant nothing,‚Äô‚Äù the Die Another Day star told <a href=#>Teen Vogue</a> in June 2017. ‚ÄúIt meant nothing.
