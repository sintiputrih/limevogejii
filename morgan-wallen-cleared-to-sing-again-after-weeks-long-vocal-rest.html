And by the third one, I felt terrible,” he&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told his followers</a>.</p><p>“They want me not to talk at all, but they said if I need to, it’s OK for something like this,” he explained.</p><p>He also revealed that he recently tore his latissimus dorsi muscle while performing in Australia.</p><p>.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">The country crooner is recovering from vocal fold trauma as well as a torn latissimus dorsi muscle. <span class=credit>morganwallen/Instagram</span></figure><p>“[My doctors] told me that if I do this the right way, that I’ll get back to 100 percent,” the “Sand In My Boots” singer shared. “And they also said that if I don’t listen and I keep singing then I permanently damage my voice. So for the longevity of my career, this is just the choice I have to make.”</p><p>Before his hiatus, the country star had faced backlash in April after he<a href=#> pulled out of a concert </a>just minutes before he was set to go on stage.</p><p>“Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, Morgan has lost his voice and is unable to perform tonight,” read a message on the venue’s screens.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">Despite cancelling six weeks of tour dates, Wallen is set to take the stage in two weeks. <span class=credit>WireImage,</span></figure><p>“Therefore, tonight’s show has been canceled.

Pitiful,”&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">another Twitter user wrote</a>.</p><p>“I’m not even that mad about not seeing Morgan Wallen bc I’ve seen him before. What I’m most frustrated about is the fact that they knew this before the concert and let all 80k plus people buy liquor and merch before canceling so that everyone got their monies worth,”&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one attendee tweeted</a>, misstating the venue’s seating capacity of 64,038.</p><p>Although there were rumors circulating that the singer <a href=#>was “too drunk” to perform</a> that night, his label quickly denied the “false” narrative.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiokZyytLXXZ5qopV9nfXN%2FjmltaGhmZLqwvsaapWavkaG5prqMnKOemaKasW7AzmaqoqaXYq6orcinZJqepJq%2FbsPEnqKsZZyku6h51aiamqRdp7K0wI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./julie-andrews-30-million-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Julie Andrews Has Made Some Smart Financial Decisions And They Paid Off</span></a>
