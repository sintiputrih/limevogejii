Some celebs don’t shy away from the paparazzi and enjoy hanging their dirty laundry for all to see, but others are a lot more secretive. And that only makes us all the more intrigued. You might have heard on the grapevine that Pat Sajak was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">getting replaced</a> as Wheel of Fortune‘s host, but now that the official announcement has been made, we can confirm that <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan Seacrest</a></strong>, a famous host across television, will be taking over come 2024.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=508 data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true>The 48-year-old media personality has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">served as the co-host</a> on Live with Kelly and Ryan since 2017, and has additionally hosted&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American Idol</a>,&nbsp;American Top 40, and&nbsp;On Air with Ryan Seacrest. In 2006, he became an annual co-host and executive producer of&nbsp;Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve and, following Clark’s death in 2012, stayed on as host and executive producer. Earlier this year, it was made public that Seacrest <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">would be leaving</a> Live with Kelly and Ryan.</p><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>Due to his supposedly flamboyant personality and fashion sense, there has been much speculation over the years whether Seacrest is gay. The large-and-in-charge American from Atlanta, Georgia, had a two-year&nbsp;on-and-off relationship&nbsp;with model&nbsp;Sara Jean Underwood,&nbsp;then began dating actress&nbsp;Julianne Hough&nbsp;in April 2010, then moved on to model Shayna Taylor from 2017 until 2020.</p><p data-characters=435 data-current-count=819 data-injectable=true>Although Seacrest has only ever dated women and has not opened up publicly about his sexuality, his string of failed romances has sparked rumors that he might be gay. Although it might seem that way, Seacrest has never outed himself as gay, nor has he overtly touched on the subject. Seacrest also has a tendency to make jokes with a seeming gay subtext; he’s also been perceived as having <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">suggestive interactions</a> with co-hosts.</p><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=320 data-injectable=false>In the last few years, more and more celebrities have been coming out of the closet and advertising their same-sex relationships. That, in turn, has encouraged even more influencers to follow suit. Right now, it’s much less unusual to be gay and out, which goes to show how progressive we have become as a society.</p><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=502 data-injectable=false>Right now, Seacrest is reportedly dating influencer and model Aubrey Paige Petcosky, so he seems to have put that rumor to bed, but we’ll never know until we know, so to speak.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2tHnRspinZaOarqS%2BxKyrZp%2BRrnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fantasy-baseball-players-should-stash-next-wave-of-mlb-prospects.html><span>←</span><span>Fantasy baseball players should stash next wave of MLB prospects</span></a>
