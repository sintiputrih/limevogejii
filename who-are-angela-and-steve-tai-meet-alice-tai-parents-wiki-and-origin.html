Her father and mother are quite close to the English paralympic swimmer. Angela and Steve have been there for them from the start of her profession. Meanwhile, Steve, her father, is said to be an IT Specialist.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Alice-Tai-1.jpg alt="Alice Tai" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Her mother, Angela, on the other hand, is a professional teacher. Tai has spoken about her parents in interviews, and she previously said that her parents urged her two children to learn to swim. Tai may also be found on Instagram, where she goes by the handle @alice__tai. She enjoys sharing her daily life with her loved ones via her account.&nbsp;Alice sometimes includes photos of her father and mother in her Instagram postings. Further information about her parents is not publicly available.</p><h2>Discover Alice Tai’s Family History: Meet Her Brother</h2><p><strong>Alice Tai</strong> comes from a supportive family since everyone in her family has been there for her since she began swimming.&nbsp;According to the Guardian, she also had a lot of help from her wonderful grandparents.&nbsp;Aside from that, Tai is not only the daughter of her father and mother, but she also grew up with her brother Christian, with whom she has a close relationship. The Tai siblings get along well, but it’s still unclear what Christain is up to. Meanwhile, Alice is the oldest of two children, with Christian being the youngest. Furthermore, Alice is in a relationship with Simone Barlaam, who is her boyfriend. Alice is not afraid to reveal to the public her love life.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Alice-Tai-2.jpg alt="Alice Tai" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Alice Tai Ethnicity And Origin</h2><p><strong>Alice Tai</strong> is of mixed Chinese and British ancestry. Alice mentioned her father in an interview, stating that he is Chinese.&nbsp;Given this, it is possible that her mother is a native of the United Kingdom. However, it cannot be proven since Alice has spoken nothing about it.&nbsp;Aside from that, she is a Poole, England native. Despite being born in Poole, Alice was raised in New Milton by her parents.</p><p>Not to mention that Tai was born with bilateral talipes and had undergone 14 corrective surgeries before the age of 12.&nbsp;Tai’s right leg was amputated below the knee in January 2022 due to severe discomfort in her right foot.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddlr%2BmecCnnp6kkWKur7CMrKuerpViwaK1jKacnqxdlrmqr8Rmq5qhXaWus7HNrapmr5mgtm6tzZ1kqKqZnLavew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./was-manny-pacquiao-in-his-prime-against-mayweather.html><span>←</span><span>Was Manny Pacquiao in his prime against Mayweather?</span></a>
