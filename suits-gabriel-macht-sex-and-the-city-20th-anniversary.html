The 46-year-old, who is famous for playing handsome attorney Harvey Specter in the legal drama, appeared in the first episode of SATC as an artist called Barkley. "So apparently it’s been 20 years since @sex.and.the.city premiered," he wrote on Instagram.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c7fe42504a50-sex-and-the-city-z.jpg><p id=es0pKNbn8auH data-wc=7><strong>Gabriel Macht played an artist called Barkley</strong></p><p id=euufszjHIkxG data-wc=86>"Humbled to be cast in the first episode after the pilot as Barkely in Models and Mortals. @sarahjessicaparker thanks for welcoming me on set and having a good laugh! #satc #20thanniversary." His Suits co-star Sarah Rafferty commented underneath the nostalgic post, writing: "I remember this so well…" The show turned leading stars Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis into household names overnight. A whole host of Hollywood actors made guest cameos, including the likes of Geri Halliwell, Justin Theroux and Bradley Cooper.</p><p id=eDhh48qfC7VM><a class=hm-link href=#>Sex and the City: Ten guest stars you didn't know made an appearance</a></p><p id=e9SVKaWqvzco data-wc=146>Sarah Michelle Gellar also took to Instagram to share pictures of her SATC character in season three. She played Debbie, a junior executive who works for a small Hollywood production company interested in turning Carrie's column into a film. "20 years ago today, a show premiered that changed television. Before #bingewatching I had to wait a week for the next episode of #sexandthecity (at least there were no commercials)," she shared. "I was so obsessed, that I begged my friend #darrenstar to be on it. I worked a full day on #bvts and got to the #satc set at 9pm and worked till the sun rose, but I didn’t care. I was too excited to be a part of this incredible show's history. So if anyone needs me tonight, I will be binge watching. Possibly in my #manoloblahnik Were you a Carrie, Samantha, Miranda or Charlotte??"</p><p id=eK7LwJXqApPC><a class=hm-link href=#>QUIZ: Which Sex and the City character are you?</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5rZ2pwYGt9eICYa21qZ6OqtrW%2FjKCYm6qZmrluucCcn61lo5rFbq3NnWStoJVisKrA2GZpaayYYq6vusivnKurkafGcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-nunn-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>Michael Nunn Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
