The <a href=#>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a> star fired back at a social media troll who criticized her daughter <a href=#><strong>Amelia Gray Hamlin</strong></a>’s steamy photo shoot.</p><p>The model, 19, took to Instagram on Tuesday, February 9, to share three pictures of herself wearing white, lacy lingerie while striking various poses on a couch. “Easy to practice self love in my @bouxavenue designed in london,” she captioned the post.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lisa-Rinna-Defends-Daughter-Amelisa-Gray-Hamlin-Lingerie-Photos-Promo.jpg><p>After Rinna, 57, dropped three white heart emojis in the comments section, one of Hamlin’s Instagram followers wrote, “@lisarinna wtf is wrong with u? U like what u see???? Discusting [sic].”</p><p>The Bravo personality was quick to respond, writing, “What is wrong with you? This is my child.”</p><p>Rinna and her husband, <a href=#><strong>Harry Hamlin</strong></a>, whom she married in March 1997, also share daughter <a href=#><strong>Delilah Belle Hamlin</strong></a>, 22.</p><p>This is not the first time in recent weeks that Amelia’s underwear photos have made headlines. After she shared a mirror selfie in a black Skims bra and Calvin Klein briefs to her Instagram Stories on January 27, fans speculated that she <a href=#>took the snap in the bathroom</a> of <a href=#><strong>Scott Disick</strong></a>’s home in Hidden Hills, California.</p><p>The teen and the <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> star, 37, sparked dating rumors in October 2020 by attending <a href=#><strong>Kendall Jenner</strong></a>’s <a href=#>controversial Halloween-themed birthday party</a> together. While a source exclusively told Us Weekly the following week that the pair’s relationship was “<a href=#>nothing serious</a> at the moment,” they <a href=#>got cozy on a beach</a> in Malibu in mid-November and <a href=#>exchanged flirty Instagram comments</a> one month later.</p><p>“The Kardashian-Jenner family is super <a href=#>supportive of Scott and Amelia’s relationship</a>,” a second source exclusively told Us in January as the pair <a href=#>vacationed in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico</a>. “They really like the two of them together and think Amelia is a great influence on Scott. Scott and Amelia are in a really good place. They have a lot of love and respect for each other and it shows.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Disick was previously in a long-term relationship with <a href=#><strong>Sofia Richie</strong></a>. He and the aspiring actress, 22, <a href=#>started dating</a> in September 2017 and split several times in 2020 before officially <a href=#>calling it quits</a> that August.</p><p>“Friends attributed their 15-year age difference becoming an issue,” a source told Us at the time. “He’s in a very much different place in his life, really focused on a more quiet lifestyle, his kids and his investment businesses, and Sofia … is really still trying to figure what she wants to do, which drove them apart over time.”</p><p>The Flip It Like Disick star shares three children with his ex-girlfriend <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a>, whom he <a href=#>dated from 2006 to 2015</a>: Mason, 11, Penelope, 8, and Reign, 6.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaloaOWerO1zaeYZp6Zp7K0ecGamqRln6uys3nDmqygoKSav26tzJ6jopldna6uuMinqmakmaO0pr7InmSpoZOofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-jackie-christie-pregnant-husband-doug-christie.html><span>←</span><span>Is Jackie Christie Pregnant With Her Husband Doug Christie?</span></a>
