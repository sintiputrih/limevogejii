The 24-year-old Hawkeye star was unrecognizable in a short platinum blonde bob and bleached eyebrows, a look many associated with Khloe.
This year’s Met Gala theme was In America: A Lexicon of Fashion, and Hailee’s interpretation included her bleached beauty look and a white, fairy-winged Iris van Herpen mini-dress.
She capped off the look by making her toned legs look extra long in a pair of sky-high gold heels."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
