On the Bulbapedia rivals page, Wally is listed as one of the Hoenn rivals. As for the starter thing, true N did not receive a starter in the games but neither did Wally. In the manga however, N is in possession of White's Tepig. So unless that changes, I think the manga deems N as one of those "non-Pokedex rivals". As for the people saying N can't be a rival because he's a villainous team leader, that's not true. Ghetsis was the true evil. N defected at the end anyway. And besides, we have a rival that's the SON of a villainous team leader (although he's not a part of it, just by relations). Btw are any of the officials looking at this? Would it be automatically taken off if someone edits N as one of the Unova rivals on the main page? It looks like more people are supportive of listing N as one of the rivals than not.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHy0tM6uo51lnmKvpnnCqKWsoZSav6awjJpkq6GmlrlvfZJwam5uXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shailene-woodley.html><span>←</span><span>Shailene Woodley</span></a>
