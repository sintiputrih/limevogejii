In the 2014 Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions Chu competed where he finished second to Ben Ingram, an IT consultant from South Carolina. Chu won $100,000 for his second-place finish, bringing his overall winnings to $398,200.</p><h2><strong>Arthur Chu Response to the gameplay style</strong></h2><p>His aggressive style of play attracted criticism among fans of the series, throughout his 11-game streak, some of whom considered his conduct to be unsportsmanlike and against the spirit of Jeopardy! His master plan earned him the nickname the “Jeopardy! Villain”, a nickname he fully took up. The most common complaints about his playing style claimed that he jumped from category to category, a procedure known as the “Forrest Bounce” after former champion Chuck Forrest.</p><p>He was successful past champions, including <a href=#>Ken Jennings</a> and <a href=#>Brad Rutter</a>, who have used the Forrest Bounce strategy like Chu, used it to increase their odds of finding Daily Doubles first. Chu picked high-value clues first because they are more likely to be Daily Doubles following inspiration by Watson, a computer that was programmed to play Jeopardy!. Chu wagered $5 on a Daily Double and responded “I don’t know” immediately after the clue was given in his second game.</p><p>Chu having held the buzzer close to the microphone, resulted in audible clicks when signaling and upon correctly answering a question, rushed quickly to the next clue. This gamesmanship he portrayed, resulted in criticism and his engagement with critics on Twitter during airings of his shows led some to declare his run similar to a Moneyball moment, and Chu a “ruthless” and “idol-killingly pragmatic”.</p><p>Jennings has defended Chu as a “good player” together with Trebek and who makes the game “more exciting”. Trebek admitted that Chu’s use of the Forest Bounce in when it disrupted the flow of the game, could be irritating although he also praised Chu and said that as the impartial host he accept disorder while in a 2018 interview.</p><p><strong>After Jeopardy!</strong></p><p>Chu contacted publicists and PR firms after his appearance on Jeopardy! to request proposals on the most proficient method to adapt the acknowledgment from his Jeopardy! run. Chu started writing a column for The Daily Beast, after he found the proposals unappealing, and did not follow suggestions that he use the ‘successful game theorist’ image and later wrote for Salon. On being Asian American, Chu has written on various aspects of nerd culture.</p><p>Apart from his opposition to the Gamergate movement, he is a vocal critic of racism and online bullying.
