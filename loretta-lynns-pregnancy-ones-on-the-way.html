In an interview, her nephew explained the inspiration behind the song:</p><p style=text-align:center>“He was a storyteller. He was depicting this woman who was kind of in the middle of her life, and that was being a mother and a housewife and not much else. And that contrasted with ‘The Ballad of Lucy Jordan,’ which Shel wrote, and was used in two different movies, most notably <i>Thelma And Louise</i>, and most notably performed by Marianne Faithfull.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/5So02Fk6cbU/hqdefault.jpg><p><a href=#>Loretta Lynn</a> has a personal connection with the track. The country singer was pregnant nine times with six children and three miscarriages. No one could have sung the song better than Loretta because she knows what it’s like to experience it.</p><h2>Lyrics Breakdown</h2><p style=text-align:center><strong>And the pill may change the world tomorrow, but meanwhile, today</strong><br><strong>Here in Topeka, the flies are a buzzin’</strong></p><p style=text-align:justify>Loretta Lynn ain’t afraid to be controversial with her songs. One moment she could be endorsing “The Pill” and at another moment she would be romanticizing the idea of pregnancy. An artist should be eclectic on her music and they should go beyond their comfort zone from time to time. Loretta is that artist who will go beyond what is expected of her and she does not compromise the music she makes.</p><p>This song is an example of how brave she is to share her experience through her song.</p><h2>Listen to the song here:</h2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMzSYyjNb74</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-2854"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-2854"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLvUp6ursaSdrq%2Bzw5qgpbFemLyue8uoqZ6spJZ6rcXNp6pmqKKatK%2BtzZywZqeemsBuu81mq6GdXayuuns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./colin-farrell.html><span>←</span><span>Colin Farrell: Latest News, Pictures &amp;amp; Videos</span></a>
