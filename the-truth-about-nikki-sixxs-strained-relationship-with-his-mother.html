"My sister went to her bedside but I wouldn't go," he explained. "I said to myself, 'I should probably go,' but I could never connect the string. I called my sister and she said she totally understood if I don't come, and I said, 'I just don't feel that she deserves it.'"</p><p>Still, the&nbsp;topic of his mother, and their never repaired relationship, came up again in 2019, when Sixx was discussing the Mötley Crüe biopic,&nbsp;<a href=#>The Dirt</a>,&nbsp;based on the band's 2001 collective autobiography of the same name. As he&nbsp;told PollStar: "The hard part of the film for me, which I didn't expect, was seeing my relationship with my mother, who passed away a few years ago without us being able to resolve our issues. The movie brought up a lot of pain around that.&nbsp;My grandparents, who aren't shown in the movie, were always there for me [...] But me and my mom could never meet in the middle. It's not something I'm proud of. I'm still confused about it."&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, Sixx has a very different relationship with his own children, having noted that,&nbsp;"No matter what happens in my kids' lives, I'll be there for them. My family means everything to me and I will do anything for them."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BlGlwbHBfqbWmedOrrK2gXZavsMHTZqWio5ueerS117GqZqukp66qusSdZKudnJbBqrvNrJ%2BiqF2strW0jKGgrGWdpMGpsdFo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rick-ciuccio-obituary-honoring-the-memory-of-rick-ciuccio-death.html><span>←</span><span>Rick Ciuccio Obituary, Honoring The Memory Of Rick Ciuccio Death</span></a>
