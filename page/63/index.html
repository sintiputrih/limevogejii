ASUS is updating their GL70x line today with the Strix SCAR II GL704, which looks like a nice upgrade for their Strix line. The GL704 has taken the thin-bezel revolution to the 17-inch gaming laptop, making it about the same size as previous 15.6-inch models.
The ASUS ROG Strix SCAR II GL704 is a bit of a mouthful of a name, but it should offer good performance for a mid-range gaming notebook, with either an Intel Core i5-8300H, or Core i7-8750H processor, and the NVIDIA GTX 1060 GPU.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Cecil Exum Death Cause | Dante Exum Father Passed Away And Family</h2><time>Jul 2, 2024</time>
