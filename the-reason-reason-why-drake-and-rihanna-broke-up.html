In July 2019, Drizzy featured on a Chris Brown track called "No Guidance," which boasted a <a href=#>music video</a>&nbsp;showcasing Breezy and Drake in a dance-off.</p><p>Of the somewhat surprising collab, Drake explained to <a href=#>Rap Radar</a>, "We've come together before and tried to link and make music, and I think we were always kind of forcing it. I think there was always resentment on both sides. You know, really at the end of the day, when you kind of step away from it and break it down, you start to feel silly 'cause it's over girl stuff, you know? But obviously, that can snowball into real s**t, and that's what happened in this situation."</p><p>Naturally, Drake was <a href=#>criticized</a> for seemingly trivializing the fact that he and Brown didn't both just date Rihanna, but that Brown had infamously battered her. However, he insisted that he didn't want Rihanna to ever feel disrespected, adding to Rap Radar of his feud with Brown, "I think we just both grew up to the point that that person that was in the middle of us is like, no longer a part of either of our lives currently, and I have the utmost love and respect for her. I think of her as family more than anything."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamplZoF4e9OhnGaqlZbAsLqMq5yaq5%2Bjeri02Gabq5mbmnqiusNmqaKgkaO7onnBq6aknV2qvXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./interview-michael-mcdonald-doobie-brothers-steely-dan-html.html><span>←</span><span>The Greatest and Yacht-iest of the Doobie Brothers, According to Michael McDonald</span></a>
