Some celebrity couples couldn’t help splitting — and later rekindling — multiples times in their relationships.
Justin Bieber and Hailey Bieber (née Baldwin) dated off and on from 2015 to 2016 before they reconciled in June 2018 — just three months after the “Intentions” singer called it quits with Selena Gomez. Justin and the model tied the knot at a New York City courthouse in September 2018. One year later, they wed for a second time at a larger ceremony in South Carolina."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
