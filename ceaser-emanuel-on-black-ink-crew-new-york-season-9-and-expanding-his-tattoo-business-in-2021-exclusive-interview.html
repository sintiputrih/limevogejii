Not what is around the community, what's it like. None of that. And for me to go from $5,000 a month to $25,000 a month for rent, it was just, especially for that area, it just was ridiculous. I just had a slumlord that was basically just trying to get over. And to this day, he's still trying to get over. I gave up the property. He's trying to sue me, bring me back to court saying I didn't surrender it. I was just dealing with a slumlord. I'm just happy that I'm out of that situation.<strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>In a <a href=#>recent interview</a>, you said that the closure of 113th was a blessing in disguise, because it meant that you could move on to new things. You've talked about expanding Black Ink. Is there anywhere you're hoping to open next?</strong></p><p>Yeah. Like I'm not going to lie, 113th was, I didn't realize it, but 113th was like my ball and chain. It always kept me in one position, in one spot and I think releasing it and letting it go, it freed me up. So now I'm opening up shops everywhere. I just opened up in Houston. I'm about to open up Milwaukee. I'm working on Dallas. I'm working on Boston, I'm working on the DMV [D.C., Maryland, Virginia], Tampa, and one other town that I'm kind of keeping under wraps, but it's in New York.</p><p><strong>You've got so much going on then.</strong></p><p>Yeah. I try to keep busy, idle time is the devil's playground. So I like to stay busy, busy, busy, busy until I have to sleep, get up and be busy again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbHBmZ4V0e8KemKydomKyrq3NrpylZZ%2BjeqO4wJyiZqGeoHqkvsSwZKedp2LGsL7KZqqemaOku26FjJqlnWWVrb2iusOipaBlmJ7AbsDArauop12XwrS1zZ6qrGWZo3pzfJFqZJ6wk6HCtLXVnmSipqSav7e1xLBm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carolina-panthers-2023-2024-home-game-tickets-schedule-prices.html><span>←</span><span>Carolina Panthers 2023-24 home games: Where to buy tickets</span></a>
