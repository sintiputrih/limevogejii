Schiavone then shared the news that Starkz was also signed too.</p><p>“Yes it is [a great story]. Speaking of 18 year olders, we just signed another 18 year older,” Schiavone said. “Did you know that? Billie Starkz, the girl that wrestled Jade [Cargill].”</p><p>Terms of Starkz’s contract were not discussed on the show.</p><p>In addition to her appearances on AEW television, Starkz has been a regular on MLW programming in recent months. She also <a href=#>made her debut</a> in Japan in November 2022 against Yuka Sakazaki.</p><p>Billie Starkz spoke about&nbsp;potentially signing a contract during a recent interview with&nbsp;<a href=#>Denise Salcedo</a>. At the time, <a href=#>Starkz said</a> she was still a free agent and would focus on a contract once her high school graduation took place.</p><p>“I’m kind of just enjoying this ride and the high that I’ve been on. I have currently not signed anything. My goal right now is to finish out high school. I graduate in May, and I still want to be fully committed to school. So finish this year off strong, I only have a couple months left, and we’ll see where wrestling and this crazy life I love takes me afterwards.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Billie Starkz spoke with WrestleZone’s Ella Jay about her relationship with Nick Wayne and said she was very proud of their matches together. Starkz also said that Wayne has helped her outside of the ring as well, specifically with preparing for her debut in Japan.</p><p>“I was really talking about Nick with like the Japan trip stuff [to TJPW] because he went with GCW for all that jazz. And I was like, ‘What did you think?’ He was like, ‘You’re going to have a blast. You’re going to fit in and you’re going to love it.’ He was giving me little tips.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJvbGlsZWKvqrjLopxmq6SWv6zGjKygoKajYsSqwMdmmKWkXZq5qsDEZq6rnaOpuaq6xg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./advice-columnist-savage-crossword-clue.html><span>←</span><span>Advice columnist Savage crossword clue answer</span></a>
