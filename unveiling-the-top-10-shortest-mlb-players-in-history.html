Take a trip to the past as we "honor" the top 10 shortest MLB players who did so in each to demonstrate why MLB is a "joke" and oh yeah, discover a couple of challenges that even some of those on this list had to overcome.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=26fc78f6-c086-4fa9-b5c9-1cf9d4fedf4c>1. Eddie Gaedel - 3'7" (109 cm)</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=d47e448c-242b-4e9f-aeeb-3ae35111e9f2>The shortest MLB player in history is Eddie Gaedel, who stood 3 feet 7 inches. He later signed with the St. Louis Browns owned by the famous showman Bill Veeck in one of his publicity antics and became a popular figure in baseball. Gaedel's only plate appearance came in a memorable game on August 19, 1951 and he walked on four straight pitches before being run for, forever enshrining himself in baseball history.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=b9843c8c-3cd0-4fb1-b0e7-e107a6d1fe0a>2. Bob Emmerich - 5’3” (160 cm)</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=56c93e7f-5dc7-433d-9156-5eb5f59920bb>Bob Emmerich, who played as a 5-3 centerfielder and pinch runner for the Boston Braves They were not just based on skills or being undersized, but they were important to the game in the way that allowed defiance and playmakers to elevate above the size that holds many back. an entire career and yet still never amount to what a singular athlete such as Emmerich could do on a basketball court.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=0574ac08-9cdc-4b20-8f72-c88efdf9c5f0>3. Jess Cortazzo - 5’3” (160 cm)</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=3279e63f-1b66-4740-89b7-a305ff38a884>Tiny 5 foot 3 inch Jess Cortazzo, better known as Shine On the field, he embodied the perseverance and grit that all great athletes possess, highlighting the point that height presents no obstacle to leaving a legacy in baseball.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=9ead0d07-fd95-4834-8e5e-f81609f762f4>4.&nbsp; “Wee” Willie Keeler — 5-foot-4</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=5993e5cb-ce7d-478f-9af6-a322ddf73844>At 5'4" and 140 pounds, Wee Willie Keeler, a member of the 3,000 hit club, couldn't have been much bigger than that. A Hall of Fame player, his contact rate was second to only a few, and his at-bats-per-strikeout rate solidifies his place in the game's memory bank as a special performer—especially for someone of such minor-league size.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=b0de2bbe-f0e0-46ff-b776-b4da777a5aaf>5. Rabbit Maranville — 5'5" (165 cm)</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=69275120-268d-4340-a305-162006e27e61>At 5′ 5″, Rabbit Maranville managed to play an incredible 23 years in the blink leagues, with more than 2,600 career hits, 28 home runs, and one MVP season that led to a second-place finish only because he hit... The lasting effect he has on the game and his elite defense are proof positive you do not need to be tall to make a big impact.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=689c33b8-c072-45d1-9a19-dbde9a6f00f7>6. Freddie Patek - 5’4” (163 cm)</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=46aa73c4-0f6f-4f49-b5a5-f67778882605>Freddie Patek: At just 5 feet 4 inches, he was the king of agility and sure gloves in a 14-year MLB career. A three-time All-Star and 385 stolen bases later, Altuve helps serve as a reminder to hopeful baseballers out there that skills come in all shapes and sizes.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=e353ad67-0aca-4ba9-87eb-b91a681313ac>7. Phil Rizzuto - 5’6” (168 cm)</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=900a53c6-84db-4a81-8d25-50c3b4884e52>Shortstop (149): A defensive wizard and key component of the Yankees' seven World Series wins, "Scooter" Rizzuto (5-6) was the 1950 American League MVP. The lasting influence he has had on the game as a player and an announcer demonstrates how players of lower stature can truly make a world of difference in the game of baseball.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=3e5cc8d9-e57e-4773-9414-b1a5f74b5dce>8. Joe Sewell - 5’6” (168 cm)</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=07242012-2565-40b3-8edf-eab6db14cbb7>The MLB player with the second-fewest strikeouts in a career, Joe Sewell (5-foot-6), also stood 5-6. One can point to his insane hand-eye ability and nearly unheard of strikeout rate of just three Ks in 1932 to note what a rare breed of hitter he was.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=c1d47a82-710b-42cd-91eb-8285874e7bd1>9. Billy Hamilton 5-6 (168 cm)</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=11958345-d4fb-420b-882a-69e8d8a18281>Billy Hamilton (orig. "Sliding Billy) still owns the major league record for runs scored in a single season with 198 in 1894 and his prowess on the basepaths is evidence of why. He helped the game reach a higher point than either his 6-foot frame or Wheaton is capable of delivering, illustrating that size is only a small part of character and character is the true measure of a player.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=b6c5caa4-8c21-4c13-86e1-c7712a1a4a2c>10. Bobby Shantz - 5’6” (168 cm)</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=e5361966-137c-4731-aa79-ee7b72262b51>Bobby Shantz, standing at 5–6, is a pitcher of 16 years with a career record of 119–99 and 1,072 strikeouts. His great success on the mound proves that short stature is no limitation in a difficult position to play.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1 data-id=a24eee14-9679-468b-a56b-6a25c6bc9398>They are among the most of the shortest players in MLB history who created fames to remember, solidifying that skill > size, and these little guys committed their names to the record books, forever. They are living proof of what it means when others looked past their size and saw change, and they continue to pave the way for the next generation to believe that they too can play big no matter how tall or how short they may be.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0mikpZpfqru3sciloKefXam1pnnTqKdmaWBiwKm70a2crKxdormjec%2BlmLKdoqh6qrqMoaCsrJ%2Bnxg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-untold-truth-of-chance-the-rapper.html><span>←</span><span>The Untold Truth Of Chance The Rapper</span></a>
