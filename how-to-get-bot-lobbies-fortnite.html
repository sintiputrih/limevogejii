The popular battle royale game places you in online lobbies that can host up to 100 players where you can either team up or run solo as you try to climb your way to the top in a variety of game modes. Going up against so many other competitors can present a whole host of challenges, whether your opponents are highly skilled or have some effective strategies to use against you.</p><p>But if you're having a hard time nabbing a win, looking to grind out rewards and Battle Pass XP quickly, or even just make it through a game without too much of a hassle, there are certain ways that you can effectively lower the difficulty and have an easier go of it.</p><p>You could always try getting into a <a href=#>bot</a> lobby to take on some easier opponents. If you're struggling with certain challenges in Fortnite, here are some ways you can try to get into bot lobbies.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Epic Games</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here's how to get into bot lobbies in 'Fortnite.'</h2><p>In case you aren't aware, bot lobbies in video games are online lobbies that pair you up with computer-controlled bots as opposed to actual players. These bots are programmed with relatively-low difficulty and aren't skilled enough to be anywhere near as good at a game as actual players.</p><p>Bot lobbies work differently in various games. For example, in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Apex Legends</a>, a "bot lobby" will pair you up with actual players of lower skill than you as opposed to AI-controlled characters.</p><p>In Fortnite, bots are very much bots in the traditional sense. They are computer-controlled players that can't aim very well and are essentially easy pickings for players looking to gain XP quickly or just have fun.</p><p>If you want to enter a bot lobby, there are a number of ways for you to do so.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>First time playing Fortnite and Fortnite is too easy for me but fun game</p><p>Probably because I'm in bot lobbies it's easy to get kills and wins but eh I'll get better <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/cQ0IosCBrp</a></p>— King_Richard (@TheRealKingR1) <a href=#>January 16, 2023</a></figure><p>Outlets like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">VideoGamer</a> report a rather complex method of entering one. They suggest making a new account on a platform separate from your main account. Once you've made it, add that account to your main account via a friend request. Then using your main account, invite that separate account to the lobby. Once you've done that, the game will supposedly pair you up in a bot lobby where you can play using your main account at your leisure.</p><p>If you don't have access to another gaming platform or simply don't want to go through the hassle of making a new account, players like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@clovafn</a> on TikTok have other alternative methods that you can try for yourself.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@clovafn href=#>@clovafn</a><p>Here’s how to get bot lobbies on Fortnite! <a title=fortnite href=#>#fortnite</a> <a title=gaming href=#>#gaming</a> <a title=fortniteclips href=#>#fortniteclips</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=botlobby href=#>#botlobby</a> <a title=gaming href=#>#gaming</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Clova" href=#>♬ original sound - Clova</a></figure><p>This player suggests changing your matchmaking region to North America, turning the Quest Progress setting on, and then turning on the Foot Controller setting. Reportedly, this will make the game itself believe you are a bot and put you in bot lobbies, but many in the comments report that this method only works for PC players.</p><p>As of this writing, making a dummy account seems to be the most popular way for players to enter bot lobbies, but see which one works best for you.</p><p>Fortnite is available on all major gaming platforms.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZKCdpGKvsMCMpaabmpmawG6yzqurp6Gkmg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./do-you-tip-for-botox-injectors-explain-7511084.html><span>←</span><span>Do You Tip for Botox?
