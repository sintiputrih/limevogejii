Here's the answer to your question!</p><h2 id=the-experiment data-v-b3633732>The experiment</h2><p data-v-b3633732>Picking the spot where our experiment took place was key to finding out which car is the fastest in Horizon 5. We picked a stretch of motorway in the remote sections of the <a href=# data-v-b3633732>Mexican map.</a> This stretch is straight for the most part and has on small amounts of traffic on it.</p><p data-v-b3633732>We then chose a shortlist of some of the fastest cars in-game and gave them a run out. After testing over a dozen, we had our answer for the fastest car in Forza Horizon 5. Bear in mind that these are the base cars, they haven't received any upgrades, so they could in theory go faster if you sink some money into them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/racinggames.gg/data:image/jpeg;base64><p data-v-b3633732>The winner was the Koenigsegg Jesko, a car so fast in real life that it doesn't have an official top speed. Most sites will measure it at over 300 mph (482 kph) and that seems accurate. On the stretch of Mexican motorway we used, we achieved a mind-boggling top speed of 308 mph (496 kph).</p><h2 id=other-quick-cars data-v-b3633732>Other quick cars</h2><p data-v-b3633732>We have to give a mention to some of the challengers that we tested in this experiment. The Jesko's little brother, the Koenigsegg Agera RS&nbsp;achieved a top speed of 280 mph (450 kph). Mercedes' Project One, one of the promo cars of Horizon 5 managed a brilliant 275 mph (442 kph), as did the Ferrari 599XX Evo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p data-v-b3633732>One of the former fastest cars in the world, the Bugatti Chiron, got up to 270 mph (434 kph) on our route. One final mention has to go to the Jaguar D Type, which is an insane car. Somehow, this beast got up to 285 mph (459 kph) in the Mexican outback.</p><span class=disclosure data-v-ef03ed8f>RacingGames is supported by its audience.
