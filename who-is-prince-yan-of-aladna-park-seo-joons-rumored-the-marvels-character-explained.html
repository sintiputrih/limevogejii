They provide plenty of opportunity for offbeat comedy and, in the opinion of this writer, the single funniest joke in the whole film.</p><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>Carol Danvers, Kamala Khan, and Monica Rambeau have to carry out an emergency visit to the planet Aladna after they figure out that it’s Kree Supremor Dar-Benn’s next target in her quest to return life to her home planet of Hala. The villain is interested in Aladna’s oceans since over 90 percent of Yan’s planet is made up of water.</p><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=771 data-injectable=true>Their trip takes on a new level of wacky when Carol reveals to her friends that she is actually married to Prince Yan and is, effectively, the princess of Aladna. While she brushes over the details, simply describing the ordeal as a diplomatic gesture and briefly mentioning the fact that Aladna has a matriarchal society, some brief knowledge of the Captain Marvel comics will fill in the details nicely for you.</p><p data-characters=491 data-current-count=491 data-injectable=true>There’s not much we know about Prince Yan beyond that, apart from the fact that he seems to lead a peaceful, prosperous, joyful nation and that he’s bilingual. That’s right, unlike the rest of the population in Aladna who can only sing in song, Yan is able to speak normally and understand those who do, too. Like in the comics, he’s also portrayed as an incredibly good-looking man, as if straight out of a fairytale – <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">so I can see why they cast Park Seo-Joon</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Who is Prince Yan in Marvel Comics?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Captain-Marvel-Prince-Yan.jpg><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=686 data-injectable=true>Yan debuted in 2014’s Captain Marvel, Vol. 8, #9 as a prince from the planet of Aladna, where men can’t pick whom they will marry, and everyone speaks in rhymes. When mutant Lila Cheney teleported to Aladna as a child, she became engaged to Yan and, upon returning years later, the prince’s parents held her up to the deal, forcing her to go through with the wedding.</p><p data-characters=123 data-current-count=123 data-injectable=false>Lila then accidentally teleported to Captain Marvel’s ship, where she asked Carol and Tic to help with her conundrum.</p><p data-characters=555 data-current-count=678 data-injectable=false>Before Yan and Lila were married, evil alien Marlo of Sleen interrupted the ceremony, set on stealing Yan all for herself. This was when Carol intervened, fighting Marlo on behalf of Lila. After Carol won, she became Yan’s bride in Lila’s place but offered an alliance with the Avengers to Aladna’s throne in order to get out of the marriage. Tic then volunteered to marry Prince Yan in order to prevent a succession crisis. When Yan became king, he abolished the Aladna rule, giving men and women equal freedom to choose whom to marry.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGnXZ7AbrzRoqWcnV2urq95zp9kmqSRmbuiec%2BaqaRlo5q8brbOqKWsZaKqurC%2BxJ1kraCVYrqivtWeo6xlk52us63CrZyrZZWtva2tyKecnWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-hanna-cavinder-miami-hurricanes-player-her-age-height-boyfriend-stats-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Hanna Cavinder Miami Hurricanes player, her, age, height, boyfriend, stats, Instagram</span></a>
