She cheekily captioned it, “I haven’t worn a back pack since middle school. Now I have a front pack. #jujube #tulababycarriers.”</p><p>While some of her followers gushed about the adorable pic, others mom-shamed Stiles for holding the baby incorrectly, prompting her to respond on Friday, December 1.</p><p>“It was brought to my attention that in the previous photo I am not holding my baby correctly.&nbsp;Wow, I didn’t expect that. What was supposed to be a shout out of products I like, suddenly becomes an invitation to comment on my baby, and my ability as a mother,” the <i>Riviera</i> actress wrote in an Instagram post. “That’s the internet for you, the carnivorous plant from ‘Little Shop of Horrors.’”</p><p><a href=#>It was brought to my attention that in the previous photo I am not holding my baby correctly. Wow, I didn't expect that. What was supposed to be a shout out of products I like, suddenly becomes an invitation to comment on my baby, and my ability as a mother. That's the internet for you, the carnivorous plant from "Little Shop of Horrors". I was trying to keep much of my son's image private, including, I guess, his little feet. And it was just a photo taken at home, not how I normally carry him around. Thanks for the concern, anyway. Yes, Mothers, always read the safety instructions. But also, Instagrammers: instead of writing snarky comments about a 5 week old, try dancing around your living room to a Clash record. It's way more fun.</a></p><p>A post shared by Stiley Jay (@missjuliastiles) on Dec 1, 2017 at 12:52pm PST</p><p>“I was trying to keep much of my son’s image private, including, I guess, his little feet,” Stiles continued. “And it was just a photo taken at home, not how I normally carry him around. Thanks for the concern, anyway.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Yes, Mothers, always read the safety instructions. But also, Instagrammers: instead of writing snarky comments about a 5 week old, try dancing around your living room to a Clash record,” she added. “It’s way more fun.” The statement was written alongside a photo of the members of The Clash. It’s believed her son’s name was inspired by the band’s late front man, Joe Strummer.</p><p>Stiles seems to have found some support in her followers, with many of them defending her. One wrote, “Looking good. Not sure what the heck is wrong with this picture. Looks very normal to me. Congrats!” while another commented, “Moms who criticize other moms are those who simply are not happy people or dissatisfied mothers themselves. Those mothers will always be there, but don’t let them get you down. Your little one is beautiful, just like you!”</p><p>As previously reported, the actress’ rep&nbsp;confirmed to&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly </i>in June&nbsp;that <a href=#>she was expecting her first child</a> with&nbsp;then-fiancé<strong>&nbsp;Preston J. Cook</strong>. They <a href=#>wed in September</a> and&nbsp;<a href=#>announced the arrival</a> of their son in a Facebook post on November 21 by sharing a photo of the newborn’s hand.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajrZyerm6%2F06Kjnqtdnba1v4ybmJyjXZbBbrnOpmSsoJGisrO%2FjLCfqGWTp7a1tcKisZ6cXZ2ys3nOr5yrZZ6axKO70adkrKeeZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./apples-15inch-2010-macbook-pro-more-battery-life-tests-display-evaluated.html><span>←</span><span>High Resolution, Matte Display: Tested</span></a>
