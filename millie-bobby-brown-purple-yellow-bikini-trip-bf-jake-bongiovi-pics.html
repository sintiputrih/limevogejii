The actress and son of<strong> Jon Bon Jovi</strong> enjoyed a romantic getaway together and she was photographed in a fashionable purple and yellow patterned bikini as they sat at a table that had what appeared to be bottled beverages on it.

They started dating in the summer of 2021 and haven’t been shy about sharing <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>their romance</a> with the world. The Stranger Things star brought him along to the show’s fourth season premiere and they looked gorgeous while posing on the red carpet of the event.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Millie also shared her feelings for the hunk when she <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>posted a photo</a> of them sharing a sweet kiss at a <strong>Harry Styles</strong> concert in London.
