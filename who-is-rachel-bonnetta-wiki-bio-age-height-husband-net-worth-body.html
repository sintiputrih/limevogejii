One of them didn’t see his family for five years and Rachel describes their reunion as the “the most emotional experience”. He didn’t tell anyone that he was coming to visit and as soon as people recognized him, there was a whole crowd of them just following Rachel and him around because he was a much respected person. She claims how those two weeks which she spent there were life-changing for her.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Happy International Women’s Day!
