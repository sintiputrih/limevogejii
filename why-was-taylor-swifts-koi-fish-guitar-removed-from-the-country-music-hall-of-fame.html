Those who visited the Country Music Hall of Fame were met with a sign that said “artifact temporarily removed” with no explanation whatsoever. So, what happened to this iconic guitar? Was it stolen by a crazed fan? Is it being repaired? Or something else entirely?</p><h3 id=h-why-was-taylor-swift-s-koi-fish-guitar-removed-from-the-country-music-hall-of-fame data-injectable=false>Why was Taylor Swift’s koi fish guitar removed from the Country Music Hall of Fame?</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=634 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Taylor’s koi fish guitar from the Speak Now Tour has been temporarily removed from the country music hall of fame</a><br>by<a href=#>u/247person</a> in<a href=#>TaylorSwift</a></figure><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>The Country Music Hall and Fame and Museum houses over 500 musical instruments and nearly 2000 items from iconic country singers. According to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">museum’s website</a>, the goal is to document the history and culture of country music by preserving these items. Swift has donated numerous instruments throughout her career, and one of them is the koi fish guitar in question.</p><p data-characters=463 data-current-count=839 data-injectable=true>Unfortunately, the museum hasn’t given any statement about the removal of the guitar. The same can be said for Swift and her team, which is odd considering the guitar played a significant role in the singer’s early music career. At the same time, there haven’t been any police reports about a stolen instrument, so it’s safe to say that it’s in safe hands. Also, there were witnesses who saw the guitar being removed by museum staff.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hey y’all, swifties GET READY: the speak now koy fish guitar was just temporarily removed from country music hall of fame… HIGHLY suspicious <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/slLqqm2Olq</a></p>— Stella (@McdanielSt82241) <a href=#>July 5, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=473 data-current-count=773 data-injectable=true>This led to speculation that it has something to do with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Eras Tour</a> and the release of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Speak Now (Taylor’s Version)</a>. At the moment, there haven’t been many songs from Speak Now on the set list for the Eras Tour, mostly because she doesn’t own the tracks yet. The same can be said for the surprise songs. But with the release of the re-recordings for Speak Now, there is a chance that more songs from this album will be performed on upcoming tour dates.</p><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>If this is the case, this could mean that lucky fans will see the singer use this iconic guitar in the near future. More specifically, a live surprise performance of ‘Long Live,’ featuring that guitar. At the moment, none of this has been confirmed. But it’s a pretty safe wager to assume that the singer asked for the instrument back for the remainder of the U.S. leg of the tour.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46wn7Jlp5bAbsDAsqOoql2oxKqy06xkpKeZYrOqv8dmnq6hpJa%2Fbr7EpqavnZRis7O7zGaroZ1dmLy2utOrsGalpai2pHnHmqOlZZ%2BbeqetzJ5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./weirdest-laws-in-the-world.html><span>←</span><span>The 27 Weirdest Laws In The World That Have No Reason To Exist</span></a>
