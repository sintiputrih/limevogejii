Here, two celebrity spray tan experts shares their tips and tricks to achieving a picture-perfect self-tan..</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-whats-the-best-way-to-remove-self-tanner-off-hands></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What's the Best Way to Remove Self-Tanner Off Hands?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are two easy wasy to remove self-tanner. First, Marc Elrick, the founder & CEO of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>TAN-LUXE</a>, says to exfoliate. "It's the best way to get rid of an old tan," he explains. He recommends using the brand's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Glyco Water</a>, as it's packed with glycolic acid which gently breaks down remnants of self-tan. Apart from chemical exfoliation, Elrick recommends doing some physical exfoliation, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another out-of-the-box way to remove self-tanner is by applying hair removal cream to the area for up to 10 minutes. "[It] dissolves whatever is on the top layer of the skin," explains <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Sophie Evans</a>, St. Tropez's Skin Finishing Expert & Celebrity Self Tanner. She recommends leaving it on for half the time if all you want to do is lighten the color, and leaving it on the full 10 if you want to get rid of the tan completely.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, she says the brand's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Prep and Maintain Tan Remover Mousse</a> also works to remove old self-tans and correct mistakes. It contains bicarbonate of soda, urea, and cotton extract, but what Evans says make it a unique formula is that it also uses a probiotic yogurt which primes the skin and sets it to the ideal pH.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If you want to make a homemade version of a tan remover, add lemon juice to bicarbonate of soda to make a paste mix, leave on the skin for about five minutes, then lift [it] off using an exfoliating mitt or face cloth," she adds. "If you make a mistake while tanning, you can simply wipe off any unwanted self-tan with a cleansing wipe."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: These Vegan Face and Body Highlighters Will Give You The Summertime Glow You Crave</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Elrick says the trickiest areas to work around are the<strong> </strong>knuckles and wrists, but to exfoliate the hands with an exfoliating mitt and use hot water. If you don't have the time or patience for that, good ole' hair removal cream works just fine.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1on6ivXam8brPErWSsnZyberWtzaecq2Wfm7NutMCnm6w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./category-cards-with-air-slash.html><span>←</span><span>Category:Cards with Air Slash - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</span></a>
