The fierce competitor beat out brilliant minds Yogesh and James, a past winner, to walk away with the 2024 title.</p><p>“I was pretty certain I had it once I hit that last Daily Double,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a>. “And I did the math, like, four times.” Indeed, as fans know, Victoria's win was the result of cumulative points and money earned throughout the tournament.</p><p>Interestingly, it was James who had the lead after the first of two half-hour matchups.</p><p>But Victoria's Daily Double in the second game allowed her to pull again going into Final Jeopardy!</p><p>The final clue was in the category of American Women: "The New York Times wrote of this woman who had died in 1951, 'Though she was forgotten at the time, part of her remained alive.'"</p><p>Victoria decided not to wager anything, and her correct response of "Henrietta Lacks" was accompanied by this message for fans: "Great games, y'all — see you next year!"</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">So, what is the 'Jeopardy!

Well-deserved. You killed it!!!</p>— All Wonky (@allwonky) <a href=#>May 23, 2024</a></figure><p>"I never expected to be back on Jeopardy!," Victoria confided. "I never expected the call for the Invitational Tournament. Once I got the call, I never expected to win it. I did not go into this expecting to win it. So to have done it felt really completely overwhelming. It was kind of like system collapse.”</p><p style=text-align:start>As for how the humble quiz master is celebrating her surprise victory, Victoria shared, "I told my husband to go to the wine store and buy the single silliest bottle of Champagne and go to the fancy cheese shop. So we had our very fancy wine and cheese when we got back."</p><p>And how did James react to his loss? The former champ had this to say on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> following Victoria's big win: "Huge congrats to Yogesh and especially Victoria for a brilliantly played final match. The trivia community and fans of <a href=#>The Chase</a> already knew <a href=#>Victoria is the best quizzer</a> in the country — now fans of Jeopardy! Masters know it too."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwedaopWailaS9or7DsmSmmaOpsrO%2FjGtna2w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tech.html><span>←</span><span>Tech Archives Page 3 of 15 We Got This Covered</span></a>
