Some questioned whether Fagan’s work as a cannabis consultant presented a conflict of interest, given her position as a public official.</p><p>Whatever the specifics of the scandal, Fagan’s resignation is a reminder of the value of moral conduct when holding public office. As elected representatives, our leaders must protect the public’s trust and represent the interests of their voters.</p><p>When that trust is violated, our collective responsibility is to hold our leaders accountable and demand the highest ethical standards.</p><p>Learn more: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Adrian Portelli Wikipedia – Who Is He?
