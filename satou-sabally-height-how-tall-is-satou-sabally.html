This serendipitous encounter led her to regularly attend practices and paved the way for her remarkable career in the sport.</p><p>Satou Sabally embarked on her college basketball journey with the Oregon Ducks, where she quickly made an impact.

She is an advocate for positive change and social justice. Her strong commitment to making a difference in the world is a testament to her character. As a Muslim athlete, she draws inspiration from the legendary Muhammad Ali. Sabally actively engages in initiatives aimed at addressing global racism, serving as the only rookie to hold a leadership role on the WNBA Social Justice Council during her inaugural WNBA season in 2020.</p><p>Furthermore, <a href=# rel=noopener>Satou Sabally</a> is an academic achiever, having completed her bachelor’s degree in social science with a minor in legal studies in August 2020, graduating with honors in just three years.</p><p>In addition to her basketball career and academic pursuits, Sabally has partnered with UNICEF, contributing to meaningful humanitarian efforts. She is also set to join several WNBA players in endorsing Alaffia, a socially responsible beauty brand that empowers women in West Africa, particularly in Togo.</p><p>Notably, basketball talent runs in the Sabally family, as Satou’s sister, Nyara, was drafted fifth overall by the New York Liberty in the 2022 WNBA draft.
