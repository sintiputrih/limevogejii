Currently, Morrison is a retiree.</p><h3>Adam Morrison Net Worth $8 Million</h3><p>Adam Morrison is the son of John Morrison, who worked as a basketball coach and had a number of coaching positions throughout the country. So the Morrison family moved frequently, until John decided to leave coaching, when they settled down in Spokane, Washington. Under the influence of his father, Adam became a ball boy for the Spokane Gonzaga University men’s basketball team, during which time he developed into an athlete and started attending basketball camps at the university to develop his skills. However, while he attended one of the camps, when he was 13 years old, Adam’s health become worse, and he was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Anyway, he never abandoned his desire to play basketball on a professional level, as he became a star at Mead Senior High School in his hometown, and eventually entered the NBA.</p><p>Regarding his college career, he played for the Gonzaga University, and in his first season, he was named to the WCC All-Freshman Team. Before he entered the NBA draft, he also earned the WCC Player of the Year award in 2006, and twice First Team All-WCC in 2005 and 2006, and earned the Oscar Robertson Trophy in 2006.</p><p>The same year, Adam`s professional career began, when he was selected as 3rd pick by the Charlotte Bobcats. He signed a rookie contract with the club for two years, which saw a significant increase to his net worth. In his first few games, he justified the high draft position, however, he eventually lost the starting position on the team due to his poor defense, and a drop in shooting percentage. In 2007, Adam tore his ACL, and the injury kept him sidelined during the entire 2007-2008 season, undergoing a series of operations to repair the damage. He eventually recuperated, but never again wore the Charlotte Bobcats jersey.</p><p>In 2009, he signed with the Los Angeles Lakers, and won two NBA Championship titles with the team in 2009 and 2010 seasons, but his skills weren`t enough for significant playing time in the Lakers franchise during those years, playing only “garbage time”.</p><p>After the Lakers, Adam found engagement with the Washington Wizards, but stayed only for a short time, as he couldn`t fight his way into the first team, and was waived at the training camp.</p><p>Adam then chose to try his luck in European basketball, and signed a contract with KK Crvena Zvezda in Serbia, but played only eight games for the team, averaging 15.5 points, and was named as the best scorer of the team.</p><p>His next stop was Besiktas Milangaz in Turkey, which added to his net worth as well, as he stayed with the team until the end of the 2012 season. Before he decided to retire, he spent a month with the Portland Trailblazers, making a return to the NBA, but only for a short time. Adam subsequently completed his degree in sports management at Gonzaga, and was also appointed assistant basketball coach to the college team.</p><p>Regarding Adam Morrison’s personal life, obviously, he was very devoted to his professional career, as in the media there is no information about his personal life.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=4.5263157894737><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$8 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 19, 1984</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Glendive, Montana, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft 7 in (2.032 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>205 lbs (93 kg)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Basketball player</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nicknames</td><td>亚当·莫里森 , Моррисон, Адам</td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm2427219</a></td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=5.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Signed as a free agent with the Washington Wizards.
