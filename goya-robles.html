She looks to be an artist based on the photographs we’ve seen. Robles never reveals her name on social media, but they are in love. According to sources, this lovely pair has been together since 2015.

In an interview, he described his childhood as tragic. He was three when his dad left him. Goya’s mother had to wash dishes at a local restaurant to earn bread for the family. Eventually, his mom remarried, but Robles grew to be an angry kid. He usually used to indulge in violence.</p><p>He suffered physical and sexual abuse from people, including his uncle. Later he was sent to a foster home, which made him feel safe. His school management categorized him in the “at risk” category at his school. At the age of 15, his elder sister passed away. She was only 17 and made Goya reckless.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Goya Robles childhood image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Goya-Robles-childhood-image.webp alt="Goya Robles childhood image" width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>He started bunking school classes, and by turning 16, he faced two felony counts and several other charges. His mother went bankrupt while paying the lawyer. In the end, Robles was sentenced to a year in a rehabilitation center. At the rehabilitation center, he saw officers beat up one of his friends so hard that the little boy started bleeding.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Goya Robles is also a Poet" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Goya-Robles-is-also-a-Poet.webp alt="Goya Robles is also a Poet" width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Writing Poetry</strong></h2><p>The situations he had to endure during his sentence motivated him to write poetry and raps. Later he got accepted to study music at the University of Bridgeport. During his first semester, he got robbed at gunpoint, and criminals broke his nose too. Finally, he decided to join the Latino fraternity, Lambda Sigma Upsilon, and it changed his life as a person.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Goya Robles in Rattled The Movie" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Goya-Robles-in-Rattled-The-Movie.webp alt="Goya Robles in Rattled The Movie" width=476 height=346 sizes="(max-width: 476px) 100vw, 476px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Entering the Entertainment Industry</strong></h2><p>One day Goya saw a girl at a college party and fell in love with her. Later he got to know that she is a theatre artist and performs at Columbia University. He, too, decided to join an acting program and luckily got accepted at University in New York.</p><p>During his final semester, he got an opportunity to perform in a Broadway play called “Extremities.” His performance was so intense that viewers gave him a standing ovation. One of the viewers was Bradley Cooper. Brad met Goya outside the theatre and gave him compliments.</p><p>The following day when Robles went to class, his program director told him that Bradley Cooper’s manager wanted to meet him. From there, his career took off.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Goya Robles with Chris O'Dowd and Sean Mackenzie Bridgers in Get Shorty" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Goya-Robles-with-Chris-ODowd-and-Sean-Mackenzie-Bridgers-in-Get-Shorty.webp alt="Goya Robles with Chris O'Dowd and Sean Mackenzie Bridgers in Get Shorty" width=450 height=374 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In 2010, he did a short movie named “Aftershock,” where he played the role of a street gang thug. Here we would like to mention that Goya is a versatile actor and can perform all kinds of characters.</p><p>After starting his career with a short film, Goya got the chance to perform in “The Civil War on Drugs” in 2011, which gave him some confidence to stay in the acting industry, and since that that he got featured in multiple films such as “Smile Now Cry Later” “A Gangster’s Word,” “A Winter Rose,” “Hustle vs. Heartache” and “Danger One.”</p><p>Currently, he has a lifetime membership of ASDC (Actors Studio Drama School).
