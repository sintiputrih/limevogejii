Having his mom nominate me was something that I felt honored to be a part of.” (The Barkitecture cohost’s <a href=#>mother, Andrea, died</a> in February.)</p><p>Cameron then gushed about his friendship with the real estate broker. “Matt and I have been friends for 10 years,” he noted. “He scooped me up my first weekend of college and we hit up a party together and have been friends ever since.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>ABC announced in June that James would be the first Black Bachelor in the show’s history.

We’re going to be angry. We’re going to hate each other. We’re going to love each other. We’re going to cry together. These are all these things that are about to happen. I know you don’t believe it now, but trust me,’” Harrison, 49, exclusively told Us Weekly. “And lo and behold, it all happened!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Matt-James-and-Tyler-Cameron-Dish-on-Dating-While-Working-Out-With-Venus-Williams-2.jpg><p>Cameron, for his part, shared earlier this month that he <a href=#>interacts with women via DMs</a> after vying for <a href=#><strong>Hannah Brown</strong></a>‘s <a href=#>heart on TV</a> in 2019. “I shoot my shot,” he explained on Dear Media’s “With Whit” podcast. “A lot of shots don’t get made, but my dad always told me, ‘You miss 100 percent of the shots you don’t take,’ so I’m gonna shoot. Some of them don’t hit, some do, and it is what it is.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammaSpequtzJ6qZqypobKzecKapJ6qn6N6pbXSoWSopl2ZrrW1zaBkm52WpL%2BmecGamqGdnKS%2FbrzRnqSinaKafA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-kardashian-is-gqs-man-of-the-year.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Kardashian Is GQs Man of the Year</span></a>
