Half a billion hours is the equivalent of over 61 million people watching all ten episodes in 18 days. Those shows that air after the Super Bowl, it’s like having five or 10 of them. So I asked my lawyer, ‘What does that mean?’ In my case, it means that I got paid what I got paid. I’ll get a little bonus when season 2 gets picked up and a nominal royalty fee for each additional episode that gets made. But if you think I’m going out and buying a private jet, you’re way, way off. The promise was that if you made the company billions, you were going to get a lot of millions.
