After positioning her camera and pressing play on RuPaul’s “Rock It (To the Moon),” the Rinna Beauty founder started bopping away in her trendy tracksuit.</p><p class=p1>Rinna captioned the post, “Thank you @brooksmarks and @meredithmarks I LOVE THIS SWEATSUIT!!!! Thank you for sending it to me!!!!”</p><p class=p1>Brooks, who launched his namesake clothing brand at Park City Fashion Week in 2019, gave viewers a glimpse of his foray into fashion during the first season of The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City.</p><p class=p1>Given his status as a new designer, the fashion line is limited. It includes the Brooks Marks PCFW Sweatpants, which retails for $74, and the Brooks Marks PCFW Hoodie, which also retails for $74.</p><p class=p1>Brooks was quick to thank Rinna for her support, commenting, “Legendary omg” and “Thank u for supporting & repping the set.” The fan-favorite reality star also shared the IGTV to his Instagram Stories with a fire and heart emoji.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Lisa-Rinna-Dances-In-RHOSLC-Brooks-Marks-Tracksuit-Watch-Inline.jpg><p class=p1>Obviously Brooks was not the only person to comment on this Housewives mashup. RHOSLC stars <strong>Lisa Barlow</strong> and <strong>Heather Gay</strong> chimed in with their approval, as well as Selling Sunset star <strong>Christine Quinn</strong>. <strong>Evan Ross Katz</strong>, the host of Shut Up Evan, also wrote, “THE COLLAB OF THE SEASON TO BE QUITE HONEST!!!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Some fans even challenged Rinna to take the crossover a bit further, recommending the star “make Meredith put on a duster,” referencing Rinna’s brand, Lisa Rinna Collection, which is available on QVC.</p><p class=p1>Rinna isn’t the only Bravoleb to rock a Brooks Marks original. <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> sported the tracksuit for an episode of Watch What Happens Live in February 2021. <strong>Jen Shah</strong>, who has since <a href=#>been indicted for her alleged role in a long-running telemarketing scheme</a>, also wore the outfit during season 1 of Real Housewives of Salt Lake City.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6G2tK2Mq6CnppFiwLa8z6ipratdp7Wwv8ucqmaaoqS8rL%2BMppiro6NisK2706Ggp59dobavsY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jason-belmonte.html><span>←</span><span>Jason Belmonte - CelebNetWorth</span></a>
