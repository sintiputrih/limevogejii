After finishing O’Dea High School, Couples won a scholarship to study at University of Houston, and played in the Houston Cougars golf team, after which he joined the US PGA tour in 1980. In 1983 Fred won his first victory, in the Kemper Open, and over the next 25 years, Couples won another fourteen PGA Tour titles, including two Players Championships in 1984 and 1996, although only one of the majors, the 1992 Masters Tournament. However, in the same year he was the leading money winner – which obviously increased his net worth considerably – and was named PGA Tour Player of the Year, following the same title the previous year. These acheivements of course made him more famous and respected.</p><p>Fred continued to show his impressive skills while playing and had won many tournaments, including three on the European Tour, and&nbsp; particularly in match play, even becoming known as ‘Mr. Skins’, a tournament which he has won five times. Addionally, Fred Couples has been named in the US Ryder Cup team five times, which of course added to Fred’s net worth.</p><p>In 2010 Fred Couples started to play on the (Senior) Champion Tour, winning the Tour Rookie of the Year award, as he won such events as Cap Cana Championship, The ACE Group Classis and Toshiba Classic. Unfortunately he was runner-up US Senior Open and Senior PGA Championship, but Fred won Senior Players Championship in 2011 and The British Senior Open Championship in 2012; these of course had a huge impact on the growth of Fred Couples’ net worth.</p><p>What is more, Fred was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame and National Italian-American Sports Hall of Fame in 2013. In addition to this, Fred designs golf courses, and has a firm called Couple Bates Gold Design: these activities have done Fred Couples’ net worth no harm at all..</p><p>To talk about Fred Couple’s personal life, he was first married to Deborah (1981-1993) and then to Thais Baker from 1998 until her passing from cancer in 2009. Despite the fact that he has lost one of the most important people in his life, Couples is still able to remain strong and achieve his dreams, including overcoming several back problems which limited his play somewhat over the years.
