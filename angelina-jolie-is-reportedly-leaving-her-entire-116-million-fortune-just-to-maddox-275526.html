But he’s been blindsided by this mess over Maddox!”</p><p>Even though their divorce has not been settled, <a href=#>Jolie and Pitt are legally single</a> again – and Jolie has her name back – after the judge in their case granted a bifurcation. This means that they are now legally divorced even though Jolie and Pitt are still working out the details of their split.</p><p>In the past five years, Jolie Pas has produced films like the Oscar-nominated Unbroken and the 2015 flop By The Sea that starred Jolie and Pitt, and those movies have grossed more than $100 million at the box office.</p><p>Nang Lay, a member of the Cambodian Buddhist Temple of Long Beach, says that Maddox will take care of Jolie’s company because the Tomb Raider star wants to hand down her business to him. Jolie and the kids have been regular visitors of the temple over the past two years.</p><p>Maddox received his first executive producer credit when he was just 15 years old for the film First They Killed My Father, which was about the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia. Nang says that Maddox is smart, and he is currently learning all he needs to know to run Jolie’s business.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>"We must increase support to survivors of sexual violence and ensure their voices are at the center of our response." <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/F8V2wqLc17</a></p><p>— Global Citizen ⭕ (@GlblCtzn) <a href=# rel=nofollow>April 23, 2019</a></p><p>However, Pitt reportedly sees this as a spiteful move, and Jolie is adding salt to the wound after Maddox took his mom’s side in the divorce.</p><p>An insider says that Jolie has been having health issues lately, which is another reason she has started to rely more on her oldest son. Multiple reports have claimed Angelina Jolie is struggling with her weight – with one saying she weighs 92 pounds – and she forgets to eat because she is overwhelmed by her career and her kids.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Jolie will return to the big screen this fall in Maleficent 2.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRo7SmuMinmGain6G2pnnIrGSrnaCkv7Wxw6WwZqSVlsOqusZmn56qXZq7tbXRnmRqaWZiuqq4y6Kmp2WWpL%2B1wc2eZKOto6l6tbuMppidnJ%2BtenODlG5pb2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stephanie-grady.html><span>←</span><span>Stephanie Grady Wiki, Biography, Age, Height, Family &amp;amp; Wedding</span></a>
