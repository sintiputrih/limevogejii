Letourneau, the former teacher who sat behind bars for having an affair with Fualaau when he was in sixth grade back in 1996, <a href=#>opened up about their life</a> today in honor of their 10th wedding anniversary. The couple, who are parents to daughters <a href=#><strong>Audrey</strong>, 17, and <strong>Georgia</strong>, 16,</a> sat down with <strong>Barbara Walters</strong> for a buzzed-about 20/20 interview, which aired on Friday, April 10.</p><p>"There is a story of us that has a life of its own, but it's not our story," Letourneau, now 53, said. "Marriage is more of taking care of the children and, of course, marriage is great."</p><p>Letourneau first taught Fualaau, now 31, as a second grader before the two began an affair when he was 13 and in the sixth grade. Letourneau was a 35-year-old married mother of four at the time. "I thought she was a movie star," Fualaau told Walters. Letourneau added: "Incidentally, I didn't think he was looking at me at all. I was just teaching. And he was just as important as any other of my students." She joked: "But he was trouble. He just is trouble."</p><p>Their romance, however, was no laughing matter. Fualaau was arrested and gave birth to Audrey while out on bail. After breaking her promise that she would have no contact with Fualaau, she was sent back behind bars for seven years. She gave birth to Georgia while in jail and the couple later wed in 2005.</p><p>Despite their famous history, the couple appear to live very normal lives today in Seattle, where the scandal all began. They married at a winery in Washington State in front of 250 guests, and their daughters were flower girls. Two children from Letourneau's first marriage also attended. Letourneau's older children are close to the couple's daughters, but still call Fualaau by his first name.</p><p>"The wedding was fun to plan," Letourneau told Walters. Fualaau chimed in: "It was a huge relief to actually get married." (Not so normal, the couple sold the rights of their wedding video to Entertainment Tonight for a rumored $750,000.) "I don't think there's ever a full 10 good years of marriage," Fualaau said. "There's always ups and downs."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Since saying "I do," the controversial couple have rarely spoken about the scandal at home. Instead, their main priority is their children and work. Oddly enough, Letourneau works as a legal assistant now, but still misses teaching.</p><p>"I have taught since then. I have a piano student and I taught at one of the colleges. I taught math," she explained. Up next, she hopes to get her sex offender status lifted. (She previously couldn't visit one of her sick daughter's at a children's hospital because of it.)</p><p>Fualaau is a DJ and works at a home garden center, but eventually wants to produce music. "He's spontaneous, I like that," Letourneau gushed. "I love that actually." Until then, he seems to be enjoying getting behind the booth. One of his latest parties? Well, it seems the past is never going to stay just in the past. He once hosted a "hot teacher" bash. Letourneau joined in on the fun by signing autographs for attendees.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammaKueqyt2Gajnqyfqr%2BvscCuZK%2BhnJ56p8HApZiarV2ku6SxjKGmrKyVmXqpu9Nmq56Zk52ys3nPmqmtsV1nfXKBkGpraA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kaitlin-armstrongs-escape-plan-fugitive-yoga-teacher-had-a-6350-nose-job-chop-hair-to-dodge-cops.html><span>←</span><span>Kaitlin Armstrong's escape plan: Fugitive yoga teacher had a $6,350 nose job, dyed hair to throw off</span></a>
