Many of them also run their own errands and wear lounge attire while out and about. When I see models like <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Emily Ratajkowski</strong></a> wear leggings, I always assume they’re lululemon. (I mean, they are the most popular leggings of all time.) I recently learned, however, that EmRata’s go-to boot cut leggings are from another fan favorite athletic apparel brand: Alo Yoga.</p><p>The model has been spotted numerous times in the past couple weeks wearing the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Alo Airbrush High Waist Boot Cut Leggings</a> while braving the New York City cold. In her most recent outing, Ratajkowski made the laidback bottoms look ultra-chic by pairing them with a brown puffer coat, Nike sneakers, chunky gold earrings and futuristic shades.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-1952530690.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Alo Airbrush High Waist Boot Cut Leggings</a> for $119 at Revolve!</strong></p><p>When yoga pants first became popular in the 2010s, the boot cut style was all the rage. As time went on, more form-fitting silhouettes have become more common — although, if EmRata’s favorite style is any indication, I think boot cut pants are about to have their moment again. I consider them to be a cross between leggings and sweatpants: They hug and support you in all the right places, then give you some extra space to move around and experiment with footwear. Essentially, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Alo’s boot cut leggings</a> are super versatile and fun for lounge days, errand runs and everything in between.</p><p>Shoppers — especially taller people over 5’8″ — are also huge fans of these pants. Many explain that these are <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the first boot cut style they have found that areactually&nbsp; long enough for their legs</a>, providing them with the perfect fit. “These are amazing,” one customer raves. “The length of the leggings is perfect for us <span class=highlight-text>tall</span> girlies. I love how they are fitting too but are not uncomfortable and still have some great stretch.”</p><p>Others mention that aside from lounging, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">these can also hold their own at the gym</a>. “These are my favorite pants. I wear them every chance I get,” another reviewer says. “They are great for reformer Pilates. The straps don’t slip on my thighs. That is all I ask for when looking for <span class=highlight-text>workout</span> leggings. I love them!”</p><p>As someone who has an embarrassing amount of straight leg leggings, I’m officially convinced it’s time to add a bootcut pair (or two) to my collection stat. After sifting through reviews (and, of course, seeing EmRata rock these) I strongly believe there’s no better option than the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Alo Airbrush High Waist Boot Cut Leggings</a>. Take my advice — be sure to stock up before they get&nbsp;too popular and sell out!</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Not what you’re looking for?
