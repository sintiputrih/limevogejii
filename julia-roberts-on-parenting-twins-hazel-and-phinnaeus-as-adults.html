Now, she’s opening up about what it’s like to parent them now that they’re all grown up and<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> away at college</a>. And according to the Steel Magnolias beauty, it’s not all that different from when they were children. “I parent them the same way out of the house that I parented them in the house, which is ‘Are you getting enough sleep? You sound like you’re sick, are you drinking enough tea? Text me when you get home. I can see that you’re home safe and sound,'” she explained to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Hoda Kotb</strong></a> and <strong>Mahershala Ali</strong> during the December 4 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>episode of Today</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“And I have immense amount of appreciation for both of my older kids because they still allow me to be the same mom to them and it’s not eye-rolling,” the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Leave the World Behind star</a> continued. “There’s a huge amount of understanding.” Julia and husband <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Daniel Moder</strong></a>, 56, welcomed their twins in 2004. They also share son <strong>Henry Daniel Moder</strong>, 16.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>According to the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ticket to Paradise&nbsp;</a>star, the family has typical issues with technology — and she deals with it by implementing “simple” rules for everyone in the household. “So for us, we just had sort of simple rules where we had a charging station where everyone’s phones go when you get home,” she divulged. “There’s no phones at the table, certainly.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>When asked by Mahershala if it’s a “different discomfort” for her to be away for work, versus her children going to college, Julia agreed it is. “Yeah. And it’s funny too, right now me being away,” the<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> mom of three</a> said. “And so Henry and Danny are home, and then I’m in another time zone, and then Phinn is somewhere and Hazel is somewhere and we were all on a FaceTime the other day — together, all of us. And it was so fun, I might of had a towel on my wet head. We were all so happy to be together that way that we still are<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> so deeply in love</a>.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze49tZqOtnJ6ubr7Om5yrrKNivK95z5qpnqaknruoedOwoKerXZ2uu7HLZpinnF2ltaq6zZqcrqtdlsBurcOuo62rXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ivysaur-pokemon.html><span>←</span><span>Ivysaur (Pokmon) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</span></a>
