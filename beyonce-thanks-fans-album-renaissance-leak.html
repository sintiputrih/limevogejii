It means the world to me. Thank you for your unwavering support. Thank you for being patient. We are going to take our time and enjoy the music.

I feel a renaissance emerging, and I want to be part of nurturing that escape in any way possible," she said at the time. "I've been in the studio for a year and a half. Sometimes it takes a year for me to personally search through thousands of sounds to find just the right kick or snare. One chorus can have up to 200 stacked harmonies. Still, there's nothing like the amount of love, passion, and healing that I feel in the recording studio. After 31 years, it feels just as exciting as it did when I was nine years old. Yes, the music is coming!"</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
