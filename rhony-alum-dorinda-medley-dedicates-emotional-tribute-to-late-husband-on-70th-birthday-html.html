He has been gone from us for 10 years and there is rarely a day that passes that I don’t think of him,” Dorinda wrote. “Grief and loss start off so overwhelming and then as time passes, it’s not that you ‘get over it’ as people say, you just grow bigger around it. It’s always there, waiting to remind you.”</p><p id=par-4_26>Dorinda continued her emotional post saying she missed waking up to her husband as well as “having breakfast together” and the “long walks talking through life.”</p><p id=par-5_40>“I miss our family dynamic and all the joy and laughter we experienced,” she continued. “I miss my best friend, I just miss you.
