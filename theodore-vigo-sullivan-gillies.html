His parents desired a name that was both unique and meaningful.</p><p>As it was a significant decision for them, actor Daniel one mentioned in an interview that he alternates between nicknames such as “Sweetheart,” “Rasin,” and even “Calcified alien.”Their parents, on the other hand, settle on two names before his birth.</p><p>The couple still has 700 names on their list, and they also created a Venn Diagram to determine which names overlapped. Following that, they chose their top choices from the list. When he was born, the couple couldn’t decide whether to name him Theodore or Vigo.</p><p>After much deliberation, and with the assistance of a numerologist, they decided to include both names. Finally, he received both names, and because his mother adores Sullivan’s, they included it in his name as well.</p><p>According to his father, because he was born on the fourth day of the fourth month, he was given four names. As a result, they decided to name their newborn son Theodore Vigo Sullivan Gillies.</p><h2><span id=Dissolution_of_marriage>Dissolution of marriage</span></h2><p>The couple officially ended their relationship in June 2019.

Rachael stated in an interview that as long as the children are safe, she will be safe as well.</p><p>She mentioned that nobody prepares you for how difficult adulting will be, which I am discovering. The couple mutually decided to end their relationship. The reason for their divorce, on the other hand, remains unknown. The couple is still on good terms and is each other’s best friend.</p><h2><span id=Net_worth>Net worth</span></h2><p>Rachael Leigh Cook, his mother, is estimated to have a net worth of $5 million.
