Her father, Matt Ronan, was born in Okinawa, Japan, and currently resides in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, which is Jenna’s hometown. Jenna appears to have resided there with her parents as of 2021.</p><p>Her father, who is now retired from the United States Army, was also a Marine. He attended Bishop Guilfoyle Catholic High School for his education. He is also outspoken about his political and social views, as evidenced by the Unexpected’s shocking discovery of a “3 percenter” tattoo on his arm.</p><p>According to reports and as depicted on the show, Matt has had Jenna and Aden’s back throughout the pregnancy, both emotionally and financially. He wrote on Facebook in September 2020,</p><p>“I am so proud and impressed with how these two children have handled the pregnancy, the constant teenage issues, and being parents… They astound us!! We adore you.”</p><p>Matt appeared to be an equally devoted husband to his wife and Jenna’s mother, Kathy Ronan, of Nicholson, Pennsylvania.</p><p>Jenna’s two younger siblings round out the family (both brothers). Additionally, Jenna’s uncle and aunt were named Ian and Brandy Ronan.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_worth_of_Jenna_Ronan><b><span data-contrast=none>What is the Net worth of Jenna Ronan?</span></b><span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p><b><span data-contrast=auto>Jenna Ronan&nbsp;estimated Net Worth</span></b><span data-contrast=auto>, Salary, Income, Cars, lifestyle & many more details have been updated below.

Initially, her father stated that he would not obtain her vehicle. However, he did eventually obtain one for her.</p><p>Jenna Ronan, in comparison to the other current and former moms on Unexpected, was deemed to have struggled with her newfound celebrity. Of course, judging by the way she lashed out at fans, they had no right to speak disparagingly about her.</p><p>Jenna attended the same high school as her father. And, as of the last time we heard from her, her pregnancy forced her to drop out of school, forcing her to enroll in an online high school instead.</p><h2><span id=Jenna_Ronan_and_Aden_Albright_Are_They_Still_Dating_Having_a_Baby_and_Still_Together>Jenna Ronan and Aden Albright: Are They Still Dating, Having a Baby, and Still Together?</span></h2><p>As previously stated, Jenna Ronan’s pregnancy progressed more easily than that of some of the other young moms featured on the show. Fans adored how Aden Albright stood by her side throughout the ordeal. As Aden approached his 18th birthday (on Oct. 15, 2020), Jenna intended to make his day special, writing:</p><p>“Happy 18th birthday, my best friend. You are the most incredible person I have ever met. Luca and I are extremely fortunate to have you. You’re the most diligent worker, the best father, and the best partner imaginable. I could never express my gratitude enough for everything you do for us. I adore you more than you will ever comprehend.”</p><p>As we write this, fans already know that Jenna and Aden are expecting their first child, Luca Michael Albright, on June 19, 2020.</p><p>Jenna previously stated on the show that she considered pulling a Kylie Jenner and concealing her pregnancy and giving birth before any of her friends learned of it. However, this did not occur.</p><p>Anyway, the following day, she made an official announcement about the birth of her child. And since that day, her social media pages have been flooded with adorable baby photos and family portraits.</p><p>Jenna and Aden, along with Jenna’s family, celebrated Luca’s first Christmas in December 2020.</p><h2><span id=Height_Weight_and_Distinct_Characteristics>Height, Weight, and Distinct Characteristics</span></h2><p><strong>Jenna Ronan was a young and beautiful 17-year-old with a height of 5′ 5′′ and a weight of 55 kg or 121 lbs</strong> when she became a mother. Not long ago, she debuted her new look on the show, complete with newly micro-bladed brows. The young mother expressed how pleased she was with her new brows.</p><p>Indeed, she appeared to be constantly enthused about things like her regularly manicured nails or new hairstyles.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Instagram_Facebook_and_Twitter><span class="TextRun SCXW96457820 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=auto><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW96457820 BCX8" data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2">Social Media: Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter</span></span></span></h2><p>Jenna Ronan had 17.6k Instagram followers (until 12 Jan. in 2021).
