In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">PEOPLE</a>, Rexha described the entire musical experience as “a dream.” Moreover, she recalled the moment when they prepared to record the music video intro, and Snoop Dogg showed up on set with joints – which just so happened to be Rexha’s preferred way of using cannabis.</p><p>“He’s like, ‘You have to try my Death Row Joints,’ and I was like, ‘Right now, on the video set? I’m going to look high on the video.’ He said, ‘Just try it,’ and I was like, ‘Okay,'” she says. “I took a hit of it, and I got so high with Snoop Dogg. But who could say they got high with Snoop Dogg? That’s like a lifetime thing.’”</p><p data-characters=515 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true>Just a week prior, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in a video shared by Rexha</a>, the musicians acknowledged their imminent success by setting ablaze the music industry – literally and figuratively. Teasing their collaboration ahead of time and in a very timely manner, Rexha appeared in the video celebrating the effects of the drug as the duo lit up a joint, undoubtedly provided by the marijuana connoisseur, Snoop Dogg. While the internet surely enjoyed the display, Rexha’s dad was less than excited to see his daughter smoking online.</p><p>“My dad called me and was like, ‘What are you doing? Why are you smoking on the internet? Are you crazy?’ I was like, ‘Dad, it’s Snoop Dogg. If you smoke with anybody, it has to be Snoop Dogg.”</p><p data-characters=99 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>“Satellite” will appear on Rexha’s upcoming album Bebe, which drops on April 28.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2Svpq7EZqmesJiWerS0wKucrGWnna61ecitqmakmaCybsDOZqqmp5uaerixxJ1ksKGknXq0us6op2acn5y0bsDHmqusZZyeuKZ5wGajop6VqbausYytn6Kml2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-tiktoker-dana-alotaibi-details-about-her-murder-death-cause-364921-html.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened To Tiktoker Dana Alotaibi?
