I’m talking about a&nbsp;strigoi SWAT team (?!?!?!?). Up until “For Services Rendered,”&nbsp;The Strain has been relatively straightforward in its depiction of the series’ bloodsuckers. Outside of Eichorst and the Master, who exhibit enhanced intelligence for reasons that the show&nbsp;has yet to explain, the&nbsp;strigoi are rabid&nbsp;animals, predators driven solely by their compulsion to feed. They can’t speak and never betray an ounce of emotion&nbsp;– one reason Eph and Nora have come around to the idea of decapitating them is that they feel infected individuals&nbsp;lost anything that made them human the moment that the stinger went into their neck.</p><p data-characters=451 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>So for this episode to introduce (out of nowhere) a unit of soldiers, clad in black and red, toting guns that fire metal stakes, is certainly unexpected. When they appear in the Luss household just in time to rescue nanny&nbsp;Neeva, her daughter and the Luss kids from a now fully-turned Joan (whose reflection vibrates by the way)&nbsp;and other vamps, it’s a jaw-dropping, totally badass moment. Who are these guys? NYPD: SVU (Special Vampires Unit)?</p><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true>I didn’t recognize the red symbol on their uniforms or the leader. Unfortunately for Neeva’s daughter, who sustained a small cut and was therefore put at risk of infection while slapping Joan’s stinger away from the kids, this squad clearly buys into Setrakian’s take-no-prisoners approach to slaying. “Don’t touch her,” warns the unit’s leader. “She’s corrupted.”</p><p data-characters=820 data-current-count=820 data-injectable=false>Now that’s an interesting thought. As I mentioned above, we’ve seen two types of vamps on this show before – the gleefully dastardly evildoers like Eichorst, and the foaming-at-the-mouth carnivores like Joan. There’s evidently a process that needs to be undertaken for someone to become a through-and-through vampire – simply being infected by a bite or a worm just results in one becoming&nbsp;a mindless&nbsp;strigoi. Within vampiredom (which we’ll pretend is a word), perhaps there are those who wish to protect the purity of the species – much like the Nazis seen via flashback in this episode.&nbsp;To the SVU, the infected&nbsp;strigoi are dirty, corrupted, unworthy of possessing the abilities of a vampire because of the quick and dirty way in which they were turned. And they must die.</p>Pages: <span class="post-page-numbers current" aria-current=page>1</span> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>2</a> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>3</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y0wNGaoKdloprDqrHWZqqeqqaesKa%2FjKucp5yVp7KledKemKynnmJ%2BbrHPoqqonJVihHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./skylar-marie.html><span>←</span><span>Skylar Marie Net Worth, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</span></a>
