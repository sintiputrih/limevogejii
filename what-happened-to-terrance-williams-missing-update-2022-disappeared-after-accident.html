Calkins professed to have dropped Williams at the Circle K general store.</p><p>The vanishing has been a subject of exorbitant interest and has been shrouded in various network programs including Disappeared, Dateline NBC, and Anderson Cooper 360.</p><p>American entertainer and chief Tyler Perry examined the vanishing on the Al Sharpton’s syndicated program and offered a $200,000 compensation for the data for the situation. The case was archived in the series Never Seen Again’s pilot episode.</p><p>What has been going on with Terrance Williams? Terrance Williams disappeared on January 12, 2004, from Naples, Florida.
