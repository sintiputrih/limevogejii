Not that we’re uninterested in seeing the likes of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nova</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Moondragon</a> and those other rumored individuals enter the franchise, of course, but we’ve been waiting for Adam to make his mark on the Marvel universe for a long while.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=356 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>Naturally, fans have put forward many names for who they’d like to see play Him on the big screen. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zac Efron</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Keanu Reeves</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nikolaj Coster-Waldau</a> have all been suggested, but here’s one name that We Got This Covered has heard is being connected to the character behind the scenes:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stranger Things</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;Power Rangers&nbsp;star Dacre Montgomery.</p><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=805 data-injectable=true>Our source informs us that Montgomery is being eyed for the part of Adam Warlock in Guardians 3.&nbsp;This isn’t to say that he’s Marvel’s favorite, though, as he’s just one of several actors on the studio’s wishlist. It also doesn’t seem as if they’ve even formally started the auditioning process yet, but he is one talent out of a handful who could be in the running once work on the threequel gets underway.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/53908343_646513795800134_8460662155006131697_n.jpg><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=267 data-injectable=false>This intel fits with what we’ve heard before about Marvel’s hunt for Adam, too. Insider <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TheMarvelScoopMaster has previously shared</a> that casting is expected to begin in November, so it makes sense that Marvel would already have a list of names to consider.</p><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=573 data-injectable=true>Montgomery wouldn’t be a bad pick for the role, either. At 24 years old, he’s maybe a bit younger than the actors fans were thinking of, but he’s also a popular fan cast for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">other Marvel roles like Wolverine</a>, so you can bet that most would get behind his casting, if it ever came to that.</p><p data-characters=246 data-current-count=246 data-injectable=false>Reports are pointing to&nbsp;<strong>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</strong>&nbsp;heading into <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">production in 2020</a>, ahead of a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2021 release date</a>, but tell us, would you like to see Dacre Montgomery as Adam Warlock in the movie?
