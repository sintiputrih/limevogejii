And they’re just lookin’ at me, like, ‘Please stick with the psychology degree,’ you know.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpJ2ybrvRop6ipl2ks27Ax55km6GimcBurdGepa1lopqurXnCqKWsqJmnrqTFjK2fnqeirnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wally-funk.html><span>←</span><span>The Female Pilot Who Waited 60 Years To Go To Space</span></a>
