For what it's worth, Gould has a pretty good handle on how good he has it. He told DeGeneres, "As I'm driving in my limo, I'm like, 'Wait a second, I'm 13, this is my third time at the Emmys.' It's like, what am I supposed to do with the rest of my life? It's kind of all downhill from now." He's accomplished more in 22 years than many people do in their whole lives!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW1ia4N5e82oo5qmXZy8trjDZqCsZZ2qsKl50qaYq6yVp3q1tMCnZKGho2K6sLDEq6VmnpGitq3FjJyfmqqRmMGmvo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lil-durk-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Lil Durk Net Worth - Net Worth Post</span></a>
