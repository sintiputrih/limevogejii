Creator<strong> Dan Fogelman</strong> released his official statement via social media on Friday, May 14.</p><p>“Whoever casually first said ‘All good things must come to an end’ never had to end their favorite thing,” Fogelman, 45, <a href=#>wrote</a>. “While sad to have just 1 season left, also grateful to NBC for <a href=#>letting us end the show</a> how, and when, we always intended.”</p><p>The executive producer, who also writes and directs for the drama, promised, “We’ll work hard to stick the landing.”</p><p>NBC renewed the tearjerker for a fifth and sixth season in 2019, and the cast and crew have stated many times that season 6 would likely be the end of the road for <a href=#>Jack and Rebecca’s family</a>.</p><p>Fogelman explained when the season 3 finale aired in 2019 that he believed the series was at the halfway mark.</p><p>“I think we’re roughly in the middle of where the television series is going to go,” he told <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter </a>at the time. “We never set out to make a television series that was going to last 18 seasons, and so we have a very direct plan. I have script pages I have written and I’m writing that really are deep, deep, deep into the future. Like, we have a plan for what we’re going to do and I know what the plan is.”</p><p>In 2018, Fogelman revealed that scenes for the series finale have already been filmed. “The show won’t overstay its welcome, we have a story to tell, we want to do this the right way. I’ve actually already <a href=#>shot pieces of the final scene</a> of the series,” he told reporters during a For Your Consideration event in Los Angeles.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Banking that footage early was especially necessary as the cast, especially the youngest actors, got older. <a href=#><strong>Milo Ventimiglia</strong></a>, who plays Jack, recently said the show would have to come to an end at some point, especially as actors aged out of their flashback roles.</p><p>“Creatively, we run into problems. I mean, my character is dead, [and because of the timeline changes] the younger actors who play our kids are growing up and bumping against the ages of the actors who play the same characters as teenagers,” he told <a href=#>Haute Couture</a>‘s May 2021 issue. “So it’s kind of like, well, which one do you choose? There are a lot of roadblocks creatively that the writers just can’t get around. I mean, they can do tons of visual effects to make me look like I’m in my 20s, but we can’t make growing 13 and 14-year-old kids look like they’re 8 again. It’s like reconciling quantum physics or something. Time marches on, and we really can’t hold it back.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see how the This Is Us cast has reacted to the official confirmation that season 6 will be the end of the hit series.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bptaq%2FjKKqZq2jYrCiv9NmqZ6Zk6nAbsDOZp2ippGherSxwKymp2WRo7uwwc2cnKadnql8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./roger-ludvigsen.html><span>←</span><span>Roger Ludvigsen</span></a>
