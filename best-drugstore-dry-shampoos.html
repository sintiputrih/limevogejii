They work equally well for refreshing hair as they do for adding volume and texture. Constantly drying and styling your hair can be extremely damaging to the strands, so finding a dry shampoo that works for your hair type and color means you can limit the amount of times you need to wash your hair — and therefore give it a much-deserved break from heat.</p><p>Whatever your hair color, type and even scent preferences, the drugstore is packed full of options to ensure your hair always looks clean and put together.</p><h2 class=section-title>What to Consider When Choosing the Best Drugstore Dry Shampoos</h2><h3><strong>Hair Type&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Dry shampoo works for every hair type. If you have fine hair, look out for a thickening option to add volume and body. If you have curly or damaged hair, choosing a dry shampoo with biotin or keratin is a great way to deliver an extra dose of nourishment between washes.</p><h3><strong>Hair Color&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Those with dark hair may find that some dry shampoos tend to leave their roots with a slight white residue. Luckily, there are now plenty of options available specifically for dark hair, and even transparent options that work for every shade. If you are blonde, a dry shampoo with violet undertones will prevent your hair from turning brassy.</p><h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3><p>Dry shampoos work by using a combination of oil-absorbing ingredients to eliminate grease and dirt from hair. Talc and rice starch are both effective in doing so. Many also have the added benefits of biotin to maintain a healthy-looking mane.</p><h3><strong>Weather</strong></h3><p>If you live in a humid climate or find your hair gets greasier quicker throughout different times of year, dry shampoo is the perfect option to stretch how long you get out of a blow out. Investing in dry shampoo will cut down on how often you have to wash your hair and save you precious time in the morning.</p><h3><strong>Size</strong></h3><p>Dry shampoos not only come in a standard size aerosol, but also in a mini travel size. If you frequent the gym in the mornings, carrying a smaller one with you to spray on your roots after a workout will save you having to wash your hair before work.</p><h2 class=section-title>What are the Different Types of Drugstore Dry Shampoo?</h2><h3><strong>Aerosol</strong></h3><p>This is the most common type of dry shampoo. The spray can makes application easy and hassle-free, as the product is evenly distributed and leaves no mess. A quick spritz along the roots is enough to transform your hair in minutes no matter where you are.</p><h3><strong>Powder</strong></h3><p>Some people may prefer a powder dry shampoo as they are more environmentally-friendly and also less scented. Powder dry shampoo works just as effectively and now comes with a special applicator to ensure you don’t have any overspill of product fall on your clothes.</p><h3><strong>Colored</strong></h3><p>If you want to hide grays, keep your highlights looking bright or avoid white residue on your brunette locks, then go for a dry shampoo option intended for your specific hair color.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKCfpXq4tdOhZK6rX6eyt7XEsKpompWowW6w0a6erKyfp7JusNGyZKygkaK9sLvSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-the-postage-stamp-in-bingo-html.html><span>←</span><span>What is the postage stamp in bingo?</span></a>
