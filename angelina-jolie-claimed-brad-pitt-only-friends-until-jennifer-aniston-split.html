The Sun (via <a href=#>Vulture</a>) claimed, "Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie made so much noise during a hotel romp that other guests thought they had been attacked by wild animals." Not so, though, according to Jolie, who insists she and Brad were only friends until after he split from Jenifer Aniston.</p><p>In an interview with Vogue (via <a href=#>People</a>), Jolie insisted that she hadn't known much about Pitt's personal life when they met. "But it was clear he was with his best friend," Jolie said shadily. She claimed that she'd not been looking for love and that she and Brad were just "very, very good friends" for "a long time" after filming ended. "We spent a lot of time contemplating and thinking and talking about what we both wanted in life and realized that we wanted very, very similar things," Jolie said. "And then life developed in a way where we could be together, where it felt like something we would do, we should do," she continued.</p><p>Per <a href=#>People</a>, despite the barrage of reports, photos flooding in, and Pitt starting the legal proceedings to legally adopt Jolie's children, Maddox and Zahara Jolie-Pitt, their relationship status was only officially out of the bag after Jolie announced in January 2006 that she was pregnant with their first bio-baby, Shiloh Jolie-Pitt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtibn9ygI6apaCdnJ67onnJqKOinV2YuaK1zJ6bZpqilrFuvMitq2annqHGbrLRopynnKNiwq%2FAyKVko52eo7ansdFmmKeho6m8r3nSqaOirF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./women-in-world-war-2.html><span>←</span><span>8 Ladies Who Changed The Game</span></a>
