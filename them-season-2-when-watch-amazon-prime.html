Since then, several socially conscious horror films and TV shows have flooded the big and small screen, including Amazon Prime’s <strong>Them</strong>. The series was released in 2021 and set in 1953 during the Second Great Migration. <strong>Them: Covenant </strong>follows a black family who moves from North Carolina to an all-white Los Angeles neighborhood and is promptly confronted with both real and otherworldly threats to their lives. Finally, three years later, the series returns with an entirely new story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Them: The Scare</strong> is set in 1991 Los Angeles and follows an LAPD Detective who is assigned a gruesome murder that has even the most seasoned detectives disturbed.

Having got his start as a writer on <strong>30 Rock </strong>and later as a star on <strong>Community</strong>, he has since created TV shows like <strong>Atlanta </strong>starring <strong>Lakeith Stanfield </strong>and <strong>Bryan Tyree Henry</strong>, and this year’s <strong>Mr & Mrs Smith</strong>, where he stars alongside <strong>Maya Erskine</strong>. By far, his most disturbing work yet is <strong>Swarm</strong>. The series follows Dre, a young woman whose troubled personal life becomes engulfed by an unhealthy obsession with a pop star whose fanbase is known as “The Swarm.” As her passion leads her further down an isolating rabbit hole, she becomes trapped in a web of destruction she created but can’t undo. The series stars <strong>Dominique Fishback</strong>, who was previously known for her short but powerful role in <strong>Judas and the Black Messiah</strong>, as well as the blockbuster hit <strong>Transformers: The Rise of Beasts</strong>. Fishback delivers one of the best performances of her career, and <a href=#><strong>Billie Eilish</strong> makes audiences squirm</a> in her disturbing one-episode appearance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch on Prime Video</a></span></p><h3 id=lovecraft-country>Lovecraft Country</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/jurnee-smollett-jonathan-majors-courtney-b-vance.jpg><p>Fans may still be reeling from its premature cancellation, but <strong>Lovecraft Country </strong>remains an incredibly beloved show by audiences and critics alike. The series follows a young black man who travels across the 1950s United States, where segregation reigns, in search of his missing father. He uncovers a few dark secrets and faces deadly challenges along the way. Based on the 2016 novel by Matt Ruff, the 2020 TV series is adapted by <strong>Misha Green</strong>, who previously brought <strong>Underground</strong>, the story of the Underground Railroad in Antebellum, Georgia, to the small screen. Under her watchful eye, Lovecraft Country remains as entertaining as it is relevant. Green not only uncovers the deep-seated racist secrets of America’s past but also the racism within the horror genre itself, especially the works of HP Lovecraft. Featuring outstanding performances from <strong>Jurnee Smollett</strong> and <strong>Aunjanue Ellis</strong>,<a href=#> this show is one of the most memorable of the past five years.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch on Max</a></span></p><h3 id=watchmen>Watchmen</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/regina-king-in-watchmen.jpg><p>In the age of comic book adaptations, this is far and away the most entertaining and sophisticated. Set in an alternate timeline where the United States won the Vietnam War and ‘superheroes” are real and considered outlaws, <strong>Watchmen </strong>asks its audiences what it would mean for our world if masked vigilantes actually roamed the world. In this loose adaptation of the graphic novel of the same name, the series analyzes the effects of the 1921 Tulsa Race Riots and the dangers of a fascist state. It features excellent performances from a veteran cast, including the likes of <strong>Regina King</strong>, <strong>Jean Smart</strong>, and<strong> Hong Chau</strong>, and <a href=#>it also features work from recent Oscar winner <strong>Cord Jefferson</strong></a><strong> </strong>(<strong>American Fiction</strong>).</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch on Max</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51kwamxzGaqnpmjpLtufoywn56mXayuta%2FHZpimmaqku2680aKknmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./peter-nygard-is-still-alive-and-in-prison-how-rich-is-the-nygard-international-founder-in-2022-372459-html.html><span>←</span><span>Peter Nygard Is Still Alive And In Prison: How Rich Is The Nygrd International Founder In 2022?</span></a>
