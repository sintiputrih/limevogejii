I always get confused for a valet parker if I’m standing anywhere near where people park. Esther gets confused for being a busboy, as do I.

It was kind of where losers congregated and we identified as that. That was how we met, as two of the misfits who were hanging at The Comedy Store until 3:00am every night. In terms of being a partnership, I do want to be clear, and Benji will agree: We’re not a comedy duo. We both do standup on our own, we do a lot of stuff on our own, so it was never like “Let’s team up.” It never felt like a partnership, just a friendship, and we wanted to do one thing together. It was borne out of how we spent so much time together and people took notice. “Why are those two always hanging out? They’re not dating. Are they dating? Are you dating? Have you had sex? Have you kissed?” People are always asking us those questions. We couldn’t understand what was going on, and that sort of became the starting point for us. People clearly want to know what’s up, so that just got in the mood to do stuff together.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgy2cn0c00hpvbmc9o5hvzik@published data-word-count=89><b>Benji: </b><span style=font-weight:400>We have a codependent friendship and those friendships get a bad rap, but I think the codependent friendship helped us because we relied on each other.

So when his show was hiring, my friend helped me put together a packet and I was so motivated because I’ve always loved Jeff Ross since I was a kid. The packet was probably three times the length of anyone else because I really wanted the job, and I got it. His show </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Burn </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>was mostly all roast jokes, and I have always liked roast jokes. I don’t come from the nicest people, so I know how to tell mean jokes. That got my foot in the door of roast stuff.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgy2cn0c00hsvbmczub0u6qv@published data-word-count=142><span style=font-weight:400>The most fun I had on the Comedy Central roasts was working with Andy Samberg, and we worked with the Lonely Island production company on</span><i><span style=font-weight:400> Alone Together</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. I didn’t have much experience seeing people of his talent and ability work. So when you’re younger and get your first few jobs, to see someone at his level – I just think that the work on those roasts, like the James Franco roast, it was just like magic. To just come up with this idea of an anti-roast, and see it come to life, was just incredible. The one thing that’s really cool about those roast jobs or random awards show jobs that I got early on is that you get to see high-level people execute different stuff, and it teaches you a lot of stuff I wouldn’t have learned at The Comedy Store.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgy2cn0c00htvbmcosmc72q1@published data-word-count=18><b>Esther, you started out doing stuff at Second City and iO.

Even when I was in college I would take the train to the city every weekend to take my classes there. I loved that. That was the honeymoon of my life; going to improv shows at iO in Chicago, taking classes, and I really felt I was in the right place, like I really belonged. It was really awesome and magical and inspiring. I ended up leaving Chicago because I ultimately felt like I couldn’t successfully have a career there because my family was there. I just felt like if I stayed there, at night I would try to go to a show and my dad would be like “Why don’t we go to Whole Foods instead?” and it was hard to not hang out with my dad and buy food. So I made the hard decision to move to LA and I thought I was gonna pursue improv. I think standup was on my mind but I didn’t have friends and didn’t know anybody and couldn’t rely on anybody. So I had to do standup because improv was just not an option for me.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgy2cn0c00hvvbmcczorgspy@published data-word-count=12><b>What were the biggest changes/improvements in your standup from 2006 to now?</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgy2cn0c00hwvbmc19rvlhg6@published data-word-count=93><b>Benji: </b><span style=font-weight:400>There’s no words to describe how stupid I was in my first few years of standup.

I was completely clueless. I think most standups would probably say that: You’re not really funny in your first two years, and there’s a lot of snake oil salesman in standup.

I had nothing else. I had to work three side jobs, but I had no friends, no family here, and for me at that time, standup was my life. I did as many open mics every night of the week that I could and when i wasn’t I was at The Comedy Store until 3:00am watching the show and getting up on stage when I could. And it’s different now because I have my TV job, and my job on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>and two podcasts. I can’t quite give standup all the time and attention that I did early on that I’m so grateful for. But back then I didn’t really believe in having a life, and I’m glad that I do now. I missed weddings, funerals – I checked out of the real world and just was a standup comedian, or was trying to be. I think that’s something that is very different now that I miss but I certainly don’t think that it was sustainable.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgy2cn0c00hyvbmca1vof3ym@published data-word-count=14><b>Benji: </b><span style=font-weight:400>Yeah, you really throw the kitchen sink at standup when you’re first starting.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgy2cn0c00hzvbmc9g21ucpn@published data-word-count=24><b>You have some great guest appearances in season 1, including a standout character by Jim O’Heir, aka “Jerry” aka “Gary” from </b><b><i>Parks and Recreation.</i></b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgy2cn0c00i0vbmcvzum11p5@published data-word-count=63><b>Esther: </b><span style=font-weight:400>To have him on the set of our pilot was unbelievable.

Sometimes I think of five ideas and it helps to be surrounded by people you trust. For me it’s about having that discussion with people. I get to play myself and lean into whatever my personality and mannerisms are, but at the same time I still appreciate feedback.

I remember being in a first meeting with managers and they were like “You really have a voice.” And I was like, “Do they think I can sing?” I was so confused by it. I think just through that I realized yeah, I do. I know who I am. I do feel really confident and secure in who I am. But I still have a hard time writing standup material. Just because I know who I am doesn’t mean that I can always find a joke in things. I think ultimately you really want that as a standup or someone who’s writing a show, but it doesn’t always make everything easy-peasy. It’s good to know that when someone pitches an idea, I know right away if that’s me or if it’s not and that’s helpful.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgy2cn0c00i5vbmcydovmkn0@published data-word-count=80><b>Benji:</b><span style=font-weight:400> In standup you bomb so often that it kinda keeps you in check.
