It’s never confirmed that these two western-themed toys are actually related in the Pixar animated movies or as their characters in Woody’s television series.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Toy-Story-4.jpg><h2>Are Woody and Jessie from ‘Toy Story 2’ related?&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-6_39>Although Woody and Jessie binge-watched plenty of episodes of their television series while hanging out in Al’s apartment, it’s never specified if their characters were in love.

In real life, though, Bullseye and Jessie are best friends and the Prospector truly turned out to be stinky.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_46>When it comes to their love interests, Woody has been in love with Bo Peep since the first movie. In Toy Story 3, Buzz Lightyear finally confesses his love for Jessie with his “spanish mode.” Since they met, though, Woody and Jessie have a sibling-like relationship.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2>Fans have, presumably seen the last of Woody and Jessie the yodeling cowgirl&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-9_47>Toy Story 4 brought new adventures for these characters. After time together as Andy’s toys and Bonnie’s toys, Woody finally went his separate way from Jessie, Buzz, and the rest of his friends. He’s not a lost toy, though.
