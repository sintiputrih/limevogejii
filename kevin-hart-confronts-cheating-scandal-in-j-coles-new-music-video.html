He seemingly considers following through, but then turns to look at a woman in the car to his other side, who is shaking her head “no” and frowning at him.</p><p class=p1>The video then flashes forward to the <i>Ride Along </i>star at a dinner with friends when he receives a note from a woman at the bar.
