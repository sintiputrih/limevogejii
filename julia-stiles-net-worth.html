Stiles, is a well-known American actress, screenwriter and TV director who has a net worth valued at $16 million. Julia’s net worth is so high because she has successfully portrayed characters in such movies as “The Omen”, “The Business of Strangers”, “Mona Lisa Smile”, and also in all three works about a fictional character Jason Bourne: “The Bourne Supremacy”, “The Bourne Ultimatum” and “The Bourne Identity”. Since Julia began her acting career, she was able to earn a great amount of net worth, and it looks like this actress has a great future.</p><h3>Julia Stiles Net Worth $16 Million</h3><p>Julia O’Hara Stiles was born on March 28, 1981, in New York, US. She was raised together with two sisters in her homeland by Judith Newcobm Stiles, mother of the kids. Despite the fact that Julia lives in United States, her forefathers were from the United Kingdom and Germany. Stiles began building her net worth by become an actress at the age of 11 – then she appeared with the LaMaMa Theatre Company, but her first role in a movie was a little later, in 1996. Then she had a small role in the movie “I Love You, I Love You Not” written by Wendy Kesselman. Though the role was without a single word, Julia didn’t give up and tried to rise to fame again and again. The first serious investment in Julia’s net worth was made in 1999, when the movie “10 Things I Hate About You” appeared on screens. In it Julia played Kat Stratford, and the movie gained huge popularity and was even nominated for Teen Choice Awards as the best breakout performance and the sexiest love scene. Furthermore, this movie even won an MTV Movie Award as the best female breakthrough performance. This, of course, increased Julia Stiles’s net worth incredibly.</p><p>Together with the famous actor <a href=#>Sean Patrick Thomas</a>, Julia starred filming in the movie entitled “Save the Last Dance”, and this of course was one of her most successful projects during a career which started in 1993. Since 2010 she is also known for her role as a guest star in a popular show aired on TV which is entitled “Dexter”&nbsp; and is very well known not only in United States, but also around Europe. It also needs to be mentioned that Julia appears not only in movies and TV shows, but she is also known thanks to the web series “Blue” where she plays one of the main characters, together with <a href=#>Uriah Shelton</a> and David Harbour. The first episode of this show was aired in 2012 and so far has had three seasons, 10 episodes in each one. The show may be not as popular as some others which Julia has also filmed, but it also managed to be nominated for several different awards.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=25.906515580737><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Julia Stiles</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$16 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 28, 1981</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>New York City, New York, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 8 in (1.73 m)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Television Director, Screenwriter</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Education</td><td>Columbia University, Friends Seminary, Professional Children's School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Judith Newcomb Stiles, John O'Hara</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Johnny, Jane</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nicknames</td><td>Julie Stiles , Julia O`Hara Stiles , Julia O'Hara Stiles</td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/Julia-Stiles-269265743092685/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.31111111111111><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/missjuliastiles</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.32727272727273><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/juliastiles81/?hl=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005466</a></td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Awards</td><td>MTV Movie Award for Best Kiss (2001), MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance (2000),National Board of Review Award for Best Cast (2000), Florida Film Critics Circle Award, Online Film Critics Society Award, Chicago Film Critics Association Awards</td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>Hey Violet</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Nominations</td><td>MTV Movie Awards, Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actress (2001), YoungStar Awards, Teen Choice Awards, Primetime Emmy Award(2011), Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress (2010), Golden Nymph for Outstanding Actress (2010)</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Movies</td><td>"10 Things I Hate About You" (1999), "Save the Last Dance" (2001), "The Omen" (2006), "The Business of Strangers", "Mona Lisa Smile" (2003)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>TV Shows</td><td>"Ghostwriter", "Dexter" 92010), "Blue", "Saturday Night Live" (2001), "The Mindy Project" (2014)</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Deep sultry voice</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Strawberry blonde hair</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=20.221719457014><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=9.90625><td>1</td><td>[on a scene that stands out most when looking back on her time on <a href=#>Dexter</a> (2006)] In the kill room, when she first gets to put the knife in. That was really special. There was also a nice moment of collaboration where the set designers had put up pictures of all the other victims on the wall, and I remember saying to the director that I felt like it was important that Lumen acknowledge the other girls and say that it was for them, too. We did a separate shot of that, and it ended up in the final edit, which I was really pleased about. It's a great example of how collaborative the show is and what a nice environment it is to work in.</td></tr><tr readability=9.8911070780399><td>2</td><td>[on the most challenging aspect of playing Lumen in <a href=#>Dexter</a> (2006)] - I never think of myself as an actor who takes work home with them, but I was surprised, especially toward the end of the season -- around episode 10 -- when some of the details of what Lumen had experienced became really harrowing, and I started to realize that it was affecting me outside of work. One scene in particular, in episode 10, when the detectives have found DVDs showing what has happened to the victims -- it was really dark. It made it more difficult for me to sleep.</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>3</td><td>I think audiences, producers and directors included, develop crushes on actors (actresses in particular) and then lose interest and move on to the next one.

And I said 'Thanks.'</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>5</td><td>I am a big fan of horror movies but I had never thought that I had wanted to act in one because I don't think that actors get to do much in them.
