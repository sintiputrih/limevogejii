Rivera recently said, “I got a lot to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">celebrate</a>.” An avid sailor, he’s probably out on his boat today. Let’s all have a beer and acknowledge the anniversary of Rivera’s birth.</p><h2 id=h-malia-obama data-injectable=false>Malia Obama</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=531 data-injectable=true>Turning 25 years old today, it would be fair to say that Malia Obama has a lot to celebrate as well.

This <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jersey Shore</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dancing With The Stars</a> celebrity would liven up the party wherever he celebrates his 41st birthday, but he can certainly teach Rivera and Obama a thing or two about blowing off birthday steam. Sorrentino was famous for his hard-partying ways on Jersey Shore, so surely he remembers how to have a great time!</p><h2 id=h-eva-marie-saint data-injectable=false>Eva Marie Saint</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=578 data-injectable=true>Legendary Hollywood star Eva Marie Saint is turning 99 years old today.
