Aidan! The men of&nbsp;<a href=#>Sex and the City</a>&nbsp;stole the show just as much as the HBO hit’s four leading ladies. From <a href=#><strong>Chris Noth</strong></a> to <a href=#><strong>John Corbett</strong></a> and more, the fellas have gone on to great things since the show ended its six-season run and spawned two movies.</p><p>Carrie Bradshaw (<a href=#><strong>Sarah Jessica Parker</strong></a>), Samantha Jones (<a href=#><strong>Kim Cattrall</strong></a>), Miranda Hobbes (<a href=#><strong>Cynthia Nixon</strong></a>) and Charlotte York (<a href=#><strong>Kristin Davis</strong></a>) stirred up plenty of trouble in their love lives, with the help of everyone from boyfriends to husbands to best guy pals.</p><p>The drama found its way offscreen too. <a href=#><strong>Mario Cantone</strong></a>, who played Anthony Marantino, made his feelings known after a third film was put on the backburner. “It’s not gonna get done!” he said during a November 2017 appearance on&nbsp;The Wendy Williams Show. “And yes, we’re all very upset about it. I’m <a href=#>very pissed off</a> about it.”</p><p>The actor added: “Some of us needed the freaking work! So it’s really upsetting.”</p><p>Cattrall was initially blamed for the canceled project, leading to speculation of a feud between the&nbsp;Tell Me a Story&nbsp;actress and Parker. The&nbsp;Divorce&nbsp;star <a href=#>denied the rift rumors</a> in April 2018.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Jason Lewis</strong></a>, for his part, was unaffected by the ordeal. “I didn’t really think much of it at all. People like to make mountains out of molehills and I <a href=#>didn’t really pay that much attention</a> to it,” he told&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;exclusively in October 2018. “I don’t pay much attention to derogatory rancor if I can avoid it. We’ve got enough of it floating around the world, so I don’t try to promote and I try to pay attention to it very little.” The actor played Smith Jerrod on the series.</p><p>Sex and the City&nbsp;aired on HBO from 1998 to 2004. The first film debuted in 2008, while the sequel,&nbsp;Sex and the City 2, premiered in 2010.</p><p>While a third film never happened without Cattrall, the world of Sex and the City <a href=#>will return in a revival show</a>. Many of the men will join Parker, Nixon and Davis to reprise their roles in the HBO Max sequel series,<a href=#> And Just Like That</a>, which started filming in July 2021.</p><p>Scroll to see where the men of the show are now!</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Usmagazine.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6toq5WteqK6w2aroZ1dmLa1xYymnKdlp52ys7GMmqmeZaSdsrp5zaiuaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./flats-fall-fashion-pants-slim-fit-straight-leg-boyfriend-jeans.html><span>←</span><span>The 15 Best Fall Pants That Pair Perfectly With Flats</span></a>
