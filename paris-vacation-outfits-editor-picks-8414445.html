It’s the last month of the year, and that in and of itself already gives it great value. It's the month that holiday season vibes are in full swing, which naturally means joy everywhere. It’s my birthday month — yes, I’m a Sagittarius, and yes, I love being one. It’s a time for reflection, spending time with family and friends, and making new goals for the year ahead. December means so much to me, but this year, it meant even more because <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>I celebrated my 30th birthday</a> (which TBH, hasn’t quite hit me yet), and the celebrations were simply epic.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A few days before my birthday — which lands on December 4 — I packed my bags and flew to Paris to ring in the big 30 with my fiancé, best friends, and family. It was a rather spontaneous trip that was planned no more than one month before (hey, it’s how I like to do things!), which means I also had very little time to plan my outfits. For a fashion girl, that is one of the most important parts of a trip, right? Right.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I made sure I had stylish, Parisian-esque outfits — because we all know <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>how French girls dress</a> — but also pieces that were practical and, most importantly, warm, as the time we were there was expected to be among the coldest it ever gets in Paris (which it did). With limited suitcase space, I set out to create the perfect Parisian capsule wardrobe — and while I hate to toot my own horn, looking back on it now, I think I nailed it. If you, too, are curious about a capsule collection with Parisian vibes, or simply a list of elevated essentials you can wear anywhere, keep reading to see the 10 pieces I wore all around Paris.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-andie-the-amalfi-bodysuit></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Andie the Amalfi Bodysuit&nbsp;</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Andie</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I packed a few sheer cashmere sweaters, and I knew those would be too cold to wear on their own, so I added in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">this ultra-flattering bodysuit</a> from swimwear brand Andie as a base piece. I love the&nbsp; pop of black underneath something sheer — it’s subtly sexy but exceptionally practical. Plus, a bodysuit like this can be worn in a multitude of different ways, and it’s about as comfy as bodysuits get. Bonus: It’s from the brand behind that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>viral black swimsuit,</a> so you know you’re getting the best out there.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-spanx-perfect-black-pants></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Spanx Perfect Black Pants</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Spanx</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I will never travel anywhere without <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">my Perfect Pants from Spanx</a>. They’re my go-to airplane bottoms because they’re basically like sweats, but I can wear them post-eight-hour flight and still look put together thanks to their elegant, elevated design. I wore them on my first day exploring Paris and felt comfy even after wearing them for 20 hours straight. I’m serious.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-nordstrom-cashmere-scarf></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Nordstrom Cashmere Scarf&nbsp;</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I have the perfect hack that’ll ensure you look ultra chic but also remain warm: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">a cashmere scarf that doubles as a blanket</a>. My mom, sister, and I all packed Nordstrom’s oversized black cashmere scarf for our Paris trip, and it was easily the most-used thing we brought. We wore the scarf on the plane because, well, we all know how chilly it can get on there, but we also slung it around us for every single Paris outing. It not only oozes nonchalant French girl vibes, but if it got too chilly in our coats, we’d wrap it around ourselves like a blanket and be totally fine for the rest of the adventures. TL;DR? I’ll never go anywhere without <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">a cashmere scarf like this one</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cariuma-oca-low-in-premium-leather></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Cariuma Oca Low in Premium Leather</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Cariuma</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We were basically a walking Cariuma ad in Paris. My mom, sister, best friend, fiancé, and I all wore our trusty Cariumas, and none of us complained about foot pain once on the trip. We all had different styles, of course — I, for one, went with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">my go-to Oca Low in premium leather</a> — but the consensus was clear: Cariuma sneakers are made for walking… around Paris, and beyond. Plus, the sleek design ensures versatility; I wore mine with my Spanx pants as well as with jeans another day.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-hill-house-home-cashmere-gloves></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Hill House Home Cashmere Gloves</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Hill House Home&nbsp;</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I was never a glove girl. Even growing up in Minnesota, I would often leave the house without gloves, much to the dismay of my mother. But for some reason, I felt I needed to bring gloves to Paris, both for the aesthetic and the functionality, and let me tell you, I’m so glad I did. I went with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">these Hill House Home cashmere gloves</a> in a pretty powder blue for a pop of color in every look. But what I love most is the flip-top feature that allows you to easily use your fingers (like when you’re looking for directions on your phone). Chic and practical is the Parisian way, after all.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-thursday-reign-boots></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Thursday Reign Boots</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Thursday</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I had to think long and hard about the shoes I brought to Paris, eventually narrowing it down to three styles: sneakers, sexy birthday heels, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">a pair of walking-friendly but stylish boots</a>. I wanted to bring a heeled boot, but because I knew we would be walking a lot, I went with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">my chunky Thursday combat boots</a> that look so cool and fashion-forward, but are also exceptionally comfy. Considering their chunkiness, I wore these on the plane to save suitcase space and I didn’t feel like kicking them off once we landed. Plus, I wore them for a jam-packed day at museums, which entailed 20,000-steps, and I was the only one who didn’t have sore feet at the end of the day. I think these boots are to thank. Of course, they also grunge up every look, so they’re a win-win all around.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-vince-brushed-flannel-maxi-skirt></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Vince Brushed Flannel Maxi Skirt&nbsp;</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Vince</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I only wish I had owned this skirt sooner because, let me tell you, it was the most flattering and timeless piece I wore in Paris. I styled it with a sheer, green turtleneck, my chunky Thursday boots, and blue wrap coat, and I felt like a million bucks. But it’s not only beautiful, it’s also incredibly comfy and warm, as it’s made from a viscose-wool blend that’s ideal for this time of year. I wore <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">my Sheertex tights</a> underneath for extra warmth, but TBH, I probably didn't need those. Bonus: The back slit is a sexy addition.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-splendid-x-kate-young-coat></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Splendid x Kate Young Coat</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Splendid</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">This blue wool coat</a> has quickly become one of my most-worn pieces. It’s super chic and warm, and that’s exactly what I have been looking for in a proper winter topper. It’s from Splendid’s collab with celebrity stylist Kate Young, so it should come as no surprise it’s a good one. The detailing is simply *chef’s kiss,* from the tortoise buttons to the belted cuffs to the roomy pockets that were big enough to hold a water bottle (yes, really). It instantly elevated all of my outfits, whether I wore it open or cinched at the waist.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-b-low-the-belt></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>B-Low the Belt</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>B-Low The Belt</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A good belt can take a simple outfit to entirely new levels of cool.

My sister, also a belt fanatic, loved it so much that she’s getting one for herself. All that to say, don’t underestimate the powers of a really good belt — it can make even the most simple outfit look runway-ready, and that’s one of the best hacks to have on hand while traveling.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-abercrombie--fitch-faux-fur-coat></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Abercrombie & Fitch Faux Fur Coat</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Abercombie</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This isn’t the exact <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">faux fur coat</a> I brought with me to Paris, but it’s a very good lookalike I’m actually considering buying. I’ve had my fluffy, now-discontinued topper from Free People for probably eight years now, and I still love it as much as I did when I first got it. Like my wool coat, it pulls double duty by being equally warm and elevated. I wore it with jeans and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">a black Wolford bodysuit</a> while exploring Montmartre; then for my birthday dinner, I threw it over <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">my sexy red House of CB dress</a>, and et voilà, I was ready to celebrate the night away.
