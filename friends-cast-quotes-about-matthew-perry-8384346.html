Like many great shows, the dynamic of the Friends cast mirrors the vibes on screen: They all really do care about each other.

We were just hopelessly standing on the sidelines. We were hurting a lot. Matthew is one of the funniest people I’ve ever met in my life. He’s charming and hilarious. Most of our hard laughs came from Matthew.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead of Perry’s Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing: A Memoir, Kudrow — who wrote the foreword for his memoir — told the Times, “It’s a hideous disease, and he has a tough version of it. What’s not changing is his will to keep going, keep fighting, and keep living."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Adding, “I love Matthew a lot. We’re part of a family. I’m basically ending this with ‘I’ll be there for you’ [the Friends theme song], but it’s true. I’ll always be there for him.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the foreword, she shared what Perry truly meant to her, writing that he "could make me laugh so hard every day, and once a week, laugh so hard I cried and couldn't breathe. He was there, Matthew Perry, who is whip-smart... charming, sweet, sensitive, very reasonable, and rational. That guy, with everything he was battling, was still there. The same Matthew who, from the beginning, could lift us all up during a grueling night shoot for the opening titles inside that fountain."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-jennifer-aniston></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Jennifer Aniston</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ron Davis/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Entertainment Weekly</a> in 1997, the Friends co-star Aniston described him as “one of the most sensitive people I’ve ever met.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress later spoke out in 2021, admitting she didn’t realize the “self-torture” Perry experienced during their time on the hit sitcom, sharing with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Today</a>, "I didn't understand the level of anxiety and self-torture that was put on Matthew Perry if he didn't get that laugh and the devastation that he felt.
