They just are all really talented. And they were the best people for these parts.”</p><p>Do Revenge explores the events that occur after popular girl Drea (<a href=#><strong>Camila Mendes</strong></a>) forms a connection with transfer student Eleanor (<a href=#><strong>Maya Hawke</strong></a>). Drea wants to get back at her boyfriend for leaking her sex tape, while Eleanor wants revenge on a girl who outed her. The twosome decide to help one another out <a href=#>by seeking vengeance on one other’s bullies.</a></p><p>Robinson and cowriter <strong>Celeste Ballard</strong> didn’t have any specific actors in mind <a href=#>as they were bringing their leading duo to life</a>. “I will say, in Camila’s tape, I paused it at about maybe five seconds in, picked up the phone and called [producers] <strong>Peter Cron </strong>and<strong> Anthony Bregman</strong> and said, ‘We have Drea.’ It’s Camila,” she recalled. “I literally didn’t even finish. I watched her say, like, four lines and I was like, ‘And that’s it.’ And I started crying.”</p><p>The writing partners ran into some issues <a href=#>when trying to bring Hawke aboard for the role of Eleanor.</a></p><p>“It had to be Maya. And so, the movie was supposed to take place in Los Angeles. We moved it and shot it in Atlanta so we could shoot it at the same time as <a href=#>Stranger Things</a>. And I rewrote it and reset it in Miami,” the <a href=#>Thor: Love and Thunder</a> writer explained about working around Hawke’s schedule. “They were so perfect that we legit moved the production.”</p><p>Robinson continued: “Because if we waited for Maya after Stranger Things, we would’ve lost Cami. And if we had Cami in L.A., we wouldn’t have Maya. I was like, ‘Nope, it has to be both of them.’ So we moved the whole movie six weeks before production.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Florida native also praised <a href=#><strong>Sophie Turner</strong></a> for <a href=#>her hilarious surprise appearance in the satirical comedy</a>. “She’s so funny, she really went for it, she committed like no other, and to me, what a dream,” Robinson added. “I never thought she would say yes to this and she did. And I’m so grateful to have her screaming at Camila Mendes. Not to toot my own horn, but that’s iconic.”</p><p>Scroll down for a guide to Do Revenge‘s cast members and their past projects:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BZvG6%2BxK%2Bcp5%2BVYq5us9Sim55lpKR6tbTEZqWerJahtrl5xaKjpqtdqMGivoysq66clJqxbq%2FArKto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jason-oppenheim-girlfriend.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Jason Oppenheims Girlfriend?
