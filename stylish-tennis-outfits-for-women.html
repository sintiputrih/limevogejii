Most of the major sports brands are now running really considered tennis apparel collections which is great to see and quite a few fashion houses are now diversifying to jump on the trend. The more the merrier as far as i'm concerned as tennis and it's rich sartorial heritage (even the original fashion influencer Marie Antoinette was a fan!) &nbsp;deserves to be revelled in."</p><h2>Stylish tennis players to inspire you&nbsp;</h2><p data-wc=84 id=edFfAIApCtB><a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Serena Williams</a> was known for her eclectic on-court style during her sporting career (as well as being a powerhouse of a player, of course!), and 21-year-old <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Emma Raducanu</a> is making her mark in the style stakes, with sponsorships from Nike and Tiffany & Co. Other style stars on and off the court include <strong>Naomi Osaka</strong> and her love of neon and bright colours.

Generally speaking, thin 'knife' pleats (the ones that all point in the same direction and look like a concertina when pulled out) suit most figures and bestow a sleek 'n' chic fluidity across your lower half, where as wider pleats can add unwanted bulk and flounce. Pair with a tucked in polo shirt for a super polished court ready silhouette."</p><p id=emQ1GFo5KoA data-wc=42>When shopping for a tennis skirt you want space to twist and drive that forehand, also room to store your tennis balls is a bonus. Look out for flared and pleated designs that set you free to run, turn, swing and pivot.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="AffiliateProductArticleTitle_a1wx4xtc hm-heading">Nike Women's Tennis Skirt</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9c7e20471b33-nike-tennis-skirt.jpg><p>A 'pink quartz' tennis skort, anyone?

So chic.<br></p><h2>Tennis dresses&nbsp;</h2><p id=eDecZelZ18b data-wc=161>According to Laura: "The joy of #tenniscore is that there is now so much choice when it comes to tennis dress silhouettes so spend some time picking out your perfect 'ball gown' and don't settle util you've hit peak fit. My top tip when it comes to styling is to think about what is going underneath it - some tennis dresses look incredible online, but once you've got them home you realise they are extremely sheer and that the barely there straps mean that underwear suddenly becomes a consideration as it will be on show. I find investing in simple plain white or skin tone sports bras can make most dresses very wearable and then I like to have fun with the shorts I wear underneath - a flash of neon or print is always good fun as are briefs with a joyful trim or even bikini bottoms. The only fashion rule here is to make sure there's good cheek coverage!"</p><p id=eeozO0nG_Te data-wc=38>Dresses with pleated skirts are very popular and will help you stand out on the court.
