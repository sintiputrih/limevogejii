It is being speculated widely that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cavill left the series because of huge deviations in its screenplay</a> from its sourcebook. The Witcher is based on a book series by the Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski, which presents an epic tale of fate and family, chronicling the legend of Geralt of Rivia, Yennefer of Vengerberg, and Princess Ciri.</p><h2 id=h-fans-want-henry-cavill-to-play-an-iconic-spy-next data-injectable=false>Fans want Henry Cavill to play an iconic spy next</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Dear <a href=#>@mgmstudios</a></p><p>We want Henry Cavill as the next James Bond</p><p>From: everyone <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/HPNDRhAKgO</a></p>— Teej (@UsUnitedJustice) <a href=#>July 21, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=341 data-current-count=641 data-injectable=true>Hours after volume two went live, Henry Cavill toplined Twitter’s trending page, which was jam-packed with the series’ fans <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">expressing their sadness at his journey ending</a>. However, a few fans also took the opportunity to pitch the next perfect role for Cavill, a role that he almost did in the past: the legendary spy <strong>James Bond</strong>.</p><p data-characters=395 data-current-count=395 data-injectable=false>Back in 2005, Cavill was among the three final choices for the role of James Bond in the 21st Eon Productions James Bond film Casino Royale. He was screen-tested alongside Daniel Craig and Sam Worthington in October 2005. The James Bond composer David Arnold, who witnessed the testing, said <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview</a> that both of Craig’s competitors “were terrific, but very different.”</p><p>“Henry Cavill was more traditional and Sam Worthington was very young. But I think Barbara Broccoli had her eye on Daniel for a long time.”</p><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>Martin Campbell, the director, and the film’s producers reportedly couldn’t decide between Cavill and Daniel Craig, with Campbell siding with Cavill. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">EW</a>, Cavill opened up about the experience and said that he “came very close” despite not landing the role. Elaborating on the reason why was he not chosen, Cavill explained:</p><p>”The choice was between a younger Bond and a Bond closer to his 30s, which is to say, Daniel Craig.”</p><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=260 data-injectable=false>So, the role eventually went to Daniel Craig, since Cavill was only 22 at the time and the filmmakers preferred an older James Bond. But now that Cavill is 40 and has become a much more polished actor, a James Bond film with Cavill as Agent 007 sounds perfect.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=560 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Henry Cavill Is James Bond <a href=#>#HenryCavill007</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/hSJryVnbVi</a></p>— 𝔾𝕚𝕦𝕤𝕖𝕡𝕡𝕖 (@G5_Giuseppe) <a href=#>July 23, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=238 data-injectable=false>One Twitter user even <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that the next Bond film with Henry Cavill should be directed by Christopher Nolan. And fans seem to be in love with the idea. Would you like to see the witcher Geralt of Rivia as Agent 007 next? We sure do.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1prrRsmScmaaeua2%2FjK2fnmWnnsGktMSrZKOnpae7psWMoqpmp6aav26u1K1kn5meqHqiuNGemJ2xXaC7sMOMsJ%2Bim5hitqS7zaKaZpuYlr%2Bir9OeqWaglWLAqbvUpZtmqJyWxm66xLGraA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tiny-harris-hits-fans-with-this-throwback-xscape-photo-check-it-out-here-452149.html><span>←</span><span>Tiny Harris Hits Fans With This Throwback Xscape Photo Check It Out Here</span></a>
