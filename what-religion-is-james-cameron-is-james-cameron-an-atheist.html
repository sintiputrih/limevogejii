Is James Cameron an atheist?</h2><p>Cameron is most definitely an atheist and he doesn’t shy away from it. According to him he converted to Agnosticism but found it “cowardly” so he went back to being a staunch atheist.</p><p>In a post on Reddit over a decade ago, he stated: “I’ve sworn off agnosticism, which I now call cowardly atheism. I’ve come to the position that in the complete absence of any supporting data whatsoever for the persistence of the individual in some spiritual form, it is necessary to operate under the provisional conclusion that there is no afterlife and then be ready to amend that if I find out otherwise.”</p><p>Source: Ghanafuo.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmJa7orLUqGWcp51kxKmt02apnqSZnLawuoyiqmaikaKytHnCmqSeqp%2Bjeqq%2FjKOYpp2jYrCiucSrpqdlkaN6osDHnqCsrF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./skai-jackson-11-28-2023-3929359.html><span>←</span><span>Skai Jackson 11/28/2023</span></a>
