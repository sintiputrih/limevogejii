No, no, no,” Grant told <a href=#><strong>Howard Stern</strong></a> in 2016. “Whoever said they were? Only the Bible or something. No one ever said that was a good idea. I think there’s something unromantic about marriage. You’re closing yourself off.”</p><p>At the time, the London native admitted <a href=#>he could change his mind on the topic</a> for the right person, saying, “I can see the lovely aspect if you marry exactly the right person — your best friend and it’s cozy and it’s lovely. But people make so many mistakes.”</p><p>Grant <a href=#>went on to tie the knot with Eberstein in 2018</a> after they welcomed three kids together. “I still think it’s nonsense, really, and so does my wife, by the way,” the actor told Reuters in response to a question about marriage shortly after their nuptials. “But it just seemed like a nice, cozy thing to do.”</p><p>That same month, the Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves star <a href=#>revealed he had regrets about not getting married</a> sooner.</p><p>“You don’t think I’m too young?” Grant quipped during an appearance on the Today show. “No, it’s really nice. I can’t pretend it isn’t. I should have done it before! But I’m just lucky, I’m lucky. I’ve got a great wife. I love her, yeah.”</p><p>Grant offered another look into their low-key relationship <a href=#>when he shared his wife’s thoughts on his past work</a>.</p><p>“I did drunkenly watch a bit of Love Actually a few months ago with my wife, and she was the one who said, ‘It’s all about pain. It’s all about suffering,’” he shared with <a href=#><strong>Diane Sawyer</strong></a> during The Laughter & Secrets of Love Actually: 20 Years Later special in November 2022.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Eberstein has continued <a href=#>to show support for her husband by often being by his side</a> on red carpets and at industry events.</p><p>Scroll down to relive Grant and Eberstein’s relationship timeline over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNktbazx2aeq5meqXqiusNmrqKelWKur7rAZpybnaKowaa1zaxkq52clsGqu82sn6KoXam2rrHLoqWeZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./haley-slaton-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Haley Slaton Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
