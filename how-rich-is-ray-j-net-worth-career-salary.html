In the same letter, the SKIMS founder begs her ex-husband not to include Kris Jenner in his Instagram rants since it was “stressing” Jenner to “no end.”&nbsp;Ray J showed no remorse to Kris Jenner, accusing the 41-year-old musician of attempting to “ruin” his family. He also alleged that Kardashian’s notorious video was “masterminded” by her mother. In the post’s comments, he wrote:</p><p>“How about my mother, Kris?” You told people false things about me, making the black guy appear bad for your own advantage, you introduced me to Steve HIRSH, you planned everything for your family while trying to wreck mine smh – you don’t believe all moms feel stressed? Or are you unique? – I know it’s old, and I don’t care – this makes me sick – but God had and still has my back.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ray-J-2.jpg alt="Ray J" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Ray J cited Steve HIRSH, the CEO of Vivid, when attacking the Kar-Jenner family matriarch.
