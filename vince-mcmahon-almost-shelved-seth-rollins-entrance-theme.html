His accolades speak for themselves and this includes the fact that fans love singing his song. It appears Vince McMahon almost shelved his entrance theme song.</p><p>Fans simply love to sing along to his entrance song, which sometimes takes over the entire show for a while. This was very evident during&nbsp;<a href=#>WWE’s trip to Paris, France</a>. Fans even hijacked a recent promo segment between Rollins and Finn Balor by singing Rollins’ entrance theme.</p><p>The Visionary acts as a conductor every time fans start singing his entrance theme and even takes in the moment after he enters the ring following his entrance. For Rollins, the fan experience is everything.</p><p>While speaking on the latest episode of the&nbsp;<a href=#>Impaulsive podcast</a>, Rollins revealed that Vince McMahon almost shelved the theme song for good during its early days.</p><p>“I debuted the song at WrestleMania in 2021, it was in Tampa, it was a half capacity WrestleMania, it was still like ‘we’re back, but we’re not back’.</p><p>We didn’t even go back to full scale live events until like August of that year but in March we did WrestleMania, outdoors, Tampa let us have half the people, so we did it in Raymond James [Stadium]. Did the song, and when I was putting the song together, I kind of had a vision of what I wanted people to do.</p><p>When we first put that song out, Vince McMahon was actually, he was just hearing it for the first or second time, he actually took a set of the ‘whoa’s out, he didn’t get the ‘whoa’s.</p><p>He was like ‘argh, that’s not Seth Rollins, that’s not Seth ‘Freakin’ Rollins’. I’m like ‘I’m telling you’ and he’s like ‘no no no, just trust me’. I’m like alright fine, you’ve only been doing this for 80 years, or whatever.</p><p>He took the ‘whoa’s out, but in the back of my mind I’m like ‘just you wait’. No, they never went back in. The version you hear now is still the Vince version but there’s enough of the ‘whoa’s that it caught on.</p><p>Fans were also seen singing along to Seth Rollins’ theme song after&nbsp;<a href=#>Monday Night RAW last week in Buffalo</a>. It remains to be seen how Rollins will be booked before SummerSlam next month.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What are your thoughts on this story?Do you love singing Seth Rollins’ theme song as well?
