<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>17 Years After Controversial Ruling, Zab Judah Remains Adamant About InfamousFloyd Mayweather Knock</h1></header><section class=post-content><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/20210205150146/GettyImages-472029242.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Floyd Mayweather</strong></a> and <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Zab Judah</strong></a> went toe-to-toe against each other back in 2006, in a fight titled ‘Sworn Enemies’. Mayweather showcased his defensive prowess and made it a one-sided domination for the whole twelve rounds. Still, in the earlier rounds of the fight, there was a moment that made every jaw drop inside the Thomas and Mack Center, in Paradise, Nevada. Judah landed a right hook on Mayweather’s face, which had him off-balanced for a split second. Thus, the controversy loomed, some consider it to be a knockdown, while others disregard it right off.</p><p>This conjecture has been stalling in many boxing debates for 17 years now, but as it turns out, the man, Zab Judah, himself has given his side of the story. According to the referee, Mayweather only tripped and it wasn’t counted as a knockdown. However, Judah had a different outlook on the entire situation.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Zab Judah breaks his silence over the Floyd Mayweather knockdown controversy</strong></h2><p>In the interview with <strong>Mat Hoffa</strong> and his crew, Zab Judah has cleared out his perspective on the alleged knockdown of Floyd Mayweather. Although one of the co-hosts claimed that before Judah’s fight, Mayweather wasn’t knocked down, it is to be noted that Mayweather had been dropped on the canvas in 2001 with a left hook thrown by <strong>Carlos Hernandez</strong>. Also, according to the official records, this moment is considered to be the only time Mayweather was counted out during a fight.</p><p>Anyway, Judah explained that he believed he had knocked down Mayweather in the second round of their fight together. He stated, “There’s rules, your gloves touch the ground during a fight. That’s a what? Knock down.” So riding on that logic, Judah justified his overview regarding his fight against Mayweather.</p><p>Additionally, Judah stated that Mayweather won the first six rounds, and he had six rounds for himself. He also spoke about an incident inside the ring that happened. As per Zab, that incident should have gotten ‘Money’ disqualified. So what was the moment Judah was talking about?</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Judah calls out the Mayweather Team on a blatant disqualification</strong></h2><p>In the same interview, Judah talked about the infamous low-blow punch in the tenth round of the fight. According to him, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>he was tired and it wasn’t intentional</a>, and it was just an attempt for a body punch which took a whole different turn. Anyway, later Judah stated that after that punch, <strong>Roger Mayweather</strong> rushed inside the ring to attack ‘Super’.</p><p>He said, “The referee was trying to stop Roger from attacking me. That’s what y’all? Automatic disqualification. You cannot cut, it’s not f***ing wrestling, you can’t come in here and help him. What are you doing?” So, Judah stated that even he could make a huge deal about a lot of things.</p><p>Moreover, he also lauds Mayweather’s feats and his boxing prowess. He believes whatever he’s got in his life, is well-deserved as he possessed business acumen. Nobody could penetrate his impressive defensive style in the sport of boxing.
