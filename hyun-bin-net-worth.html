He’s been active in the industry since 2003, and all of his efforts have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Hyun Bin? As of early-2018, sources estimate a net worth that is at $2 million, mostly earned through a successful career as an actor. He’s also appeared in numerous films and in several music videos too. As he continues his career, it is expected that his wealth will also continue to increase.</p><h3>Hyun Bin Net Worth $2 million</h3><p>Bin attended Chung Ang University, and graduated in 2004 with a degree in Theater Studies. He returned a few years later to study for a Master’s degree.</p><p>Hyun made his first starring appearances in the television series “Nonstop 4” and “Ireland”. His popularity would rise when he became a part of the romantic comedy series entitled “My Lovely Sam Soon”, alongside Kim Sun-a and he would win the MBC Drama Top Excellence Award which helped increase his net worth significantly. Afterwards, he had his first leading role in the film “A Millionaire’s First Love”, which became a hit locally, and his next television project was “The Snow Queen” before he started to transition to more eclectic projects. He became a part of the 2008 series “Worlds Within” which was well received, and also starred in the film “I Am Happy” which was showcased at the Busan International Film Festival. In 2009, he portrayed a sociopath in “Friend, Our Legend”, which performance drew critical acclaim.</p><p>In 2010, Bin starred in “Secret Garden” which became highly popular and would raise his net worth even further; he also contributed to the show’s soundtrack, and would be recognized at the SBS Drama Awards. The following year, he starred in the films “Come Rain, Come Shine” and “Late Autumn”, the latter being a remake of the 1966 film of the same name, and in which he plays a man who falls in love with a woman on special leave from prison; the film became the highest grossing Korean film released in China. His films were screened at the 61st Berlin International Film Festival, adding to his reputation and net worth.</p><p>After returning from 21 months of compulsory military service in the Marine Corps from 2011 to 2012, he then spent most of 2013 shooting commercials with his management going independent. His acting comeback would be in the period film “The Fatal Encounter”, but it received negative reviews. His next film in 2015 entitled “Hyde, Jekkyl, Me” also had poor ratings, but in 2017, Hyun starred in the film “Confidential Assignment”, in the role of a North Korean detective secretly sent to South Korea to apprehend North Korean traitors who have formed a crime ring. The film proved successful and he would then go on to his next project entitled “The Swindlers” which also proved to be a box office hit. One of his latest projects is the crime thriller “Negotiation” and the zombie film “Rampant”.</p><p>For his personal life, there aren’t even any rumours about Bin’s romantic relationships, if any, so he is presumed to still be single.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=9.3682310469314><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Hyun Bin</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$2 million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of
