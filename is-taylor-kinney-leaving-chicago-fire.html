Thankfully, Kelly's life hasn't been only gloom and doom. The Season 10 finale was devoted to <a href=#>Kelly and Stella Kidd (Miranda Rae Mayo) finally getting married</a>.</p><p>Despite a relatively calm Season 11, Taylor abruptly left the show in January. Would he be back for Season 12?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Taylor Kinney is returning for Season 12!</h2><p>Hold on to your Chicago Fire firefighter helmet you bought at the NBC store in New York! Severide <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">will be back</a> for season 12 for sure. We don't know how many episodes he will be in or how they will explain his absence. The WGA writers have just finished striking and the SAG is still on strike so we also don't know when the show will return. But he's definitely coming back. So, that's the best thing ever.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Severide leave 'Chicago Fire'?&nbsp;</h2><p>Since 2019, the rumor mill has been working overtime on theories that Severide could be leaving the show. Chicago Fire showrunner Derek Haas previously discussed the future of two characters, Severide and Casey, on Twitter, stating, "They won't both be 51 before the winter break."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">In January 2023 Taylor Kinney took a leave of absence from the show.</h2><p>A report from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a> announced Taylor would take a leave of absence from the show effective January 2023 to deal with a personal matter. The report also noted that he told the cast and crew on Jan. 20, 2023, and it is likely future scripts will be rewritten to reflect his absence.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>On the show, Severide and his wife argued over her rushing into danger. Later, Kidd suggested if they were having issues working together, they should ask to be put on separate shifts. This could spell trouble in paradise so soon after their wedding, but we're hoping Severide and Kidd aren't headed for divorce anytime soon.</p><p>We're not sure how they are going to bring him back or how they are going to explain where he's been. I guess we're going to have to wait until whenever Hollywood gets back into the studio, they write the shows, cast them, shoot them, and edit them. It's going to be a while...</p><p>In the meantime, Chicago Fire airs on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. EST on NBC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuwMCyo6iqXaC2r7rEsmSlnZGrtq%2BzjJyfopuRnLxussirnA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./did-audrey-and-mariah-brown-get-married-are-audrey-and-mariah-still-together.html><span>←</span><span>Did Audrey and Mariah Brown get married?
