Ted was a mathematics assistant professor at the prestigious University of California, Berkley, where he was on the tenure track.</p><p>However, he left UC Berkley and was divided to live an isolated life. He used to live in a remote cabin in Montana without amenities, including electricity and water.

Even there is no report of him being involved in any relationship with anyone.</p><p>Likely, he never got into a serious relationship because the majority of his youth life he spent secluded from the crowd and chose to take the path of crime to resolve his hatred toward development.</p><p>The Unabomber case is one of the most horrific cases in American history. It was Domestic terrorism and is one of the cases in which the FBI spent a large number of its resources.

His targets were mainly scholars because he believed that these people are using their brains to advance technology which he despised. Ted is alumni of the prestigious Harvard University.</p><p>Out of all the bombs, he plant only two were defused, all others blasted. Due to his crime, he was searched by the FBI for years. Only after his brother’s help, he was found by the investigation team.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWRo7ansdKtpmaho2LBprCMpJicsqmjwKy1jKyroqScYq6ttdWeZK6mkZe8rq7Eq2SwoZaaeri0wK1knaGUYrWmecOoZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./leo-sharp-the-mule-true-story.html><span>←</span><span>Leo Sharp And The Unbelievable True Story Behind 'The Mule'</span></a>
