All award shows should follow in their footsteps and make categories genderless,” the Life in Pieces alum said. “I’m dating a nonbinary person. I’m friends with so many nonbinary people. And I think that without really shifting the paradigm in a larger way, it’s closing a lot of doors for really important voices.”</p><p>Lister-Jones also took a moment to gush about Cohen, who directed the 2023 film <a href=#>You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah</a>.</p><p>“They’re an amazing filmmaker in their own right,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Zoe-Lister-Joe-Comes-Out-As-Queer-e1709076040786.jpg><p>Lister-Jones was previously married to acting, writing and production partner <strong>Daryl Wein</strong> from 2013 to 2022. The pair’s film collaborations include 2009’s Breaking Upwards and 2012’s Lola Versus.</p><p>Lister-Jones filed for divorce in September 2022, citing “irreconcilable differences.” She previously opened up about being “in and out of an open relationship” with Wein, 40, during a September 2021 appearance on <strong>Marc Maron</strong>’s “WTF” podcast.</p><p>“It’s why I have so much indigestion,” she joked, noting that she had a “constantly engaged” jealous muscle when Wein would be intimate with other people.</p><p>During a joint <a href=# rel=noopener>New York Times</a> interview in 2012, Lister-Jones called non-monogamy “frightening territory,” while Wein said, “I take the glass half full approach in that there might be some potential to the concept.”</p><p>Lister-Jones shot back, “Of course you think that. You’re a man.”</p><p>While the twosome’s marriage didn’t last, Lister-Jones told THR&nbsp;that she is “still very close” with Wein.</p><p>“We made a lot of films together,” she added.</p><p>Prior to confirming her romance with Cohen, Lister-Jones dropped a hint about her sexuality in June 2023.</p><p>“Queer ultimatum #happypride,” she wrote via Instagram at the time alongside <a href=# rel=noopener>a photo </a>of her looking into a fridge while wearing a cheeky bikini.</p><p>Cohen, meanwhile, opened up about their coming out journey during a September 2023 appearance on the “Yenta!” podcast.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It took me a long time to come out, and then it took me a little bit longer to come out again as nonbinary,” the director explained. “It’s been a long, very, very slow, chill process. … I only through standup, like a year and a half ago, came out as nonbinary out loud to people. The first time I said it out loud I was doing standup.”</p><p>Cohen noted that the “levity” of performing comedy made the topic seem easier to talk about.</p><p>“I said it so nonchalantly,” they said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGazp5Viuaq%2F056pZqKfo7K0ecKopJ6rXaTCtXnArGSqrZWav27Dx6KjnmWUmq%2B2wMinnmamlax6s7vMmqWcnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taco-salad.html><span>←</span><span>Taco Salad with Jalapeo Ranch</span></a>
