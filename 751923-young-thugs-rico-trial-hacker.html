Concerns surrounding the rapper's weight continue, with a recent court appearance <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">sparking speculation</a> that he put on a few pounds while incarcerated. YSL co-founder Slug even testified earlier this month, demonstrating gang signs, defining the term "snitching," and more.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The Atlanta-born performer has been <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">behind bars for nearly two years</a> now, originally getting arrested in May of 2022. Amid his prison stay, countless fans and peers have shown their support, calling for his release. Recently, however, it appears as though one fan truly went the extra mile. In a new clip, Young Thug is seen standing up in the courtroom just before a recess, when a Zoom hacker interrupted the judge.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-zoom-hacker-calls-for-young-thug-s-release>Zoom Hacker Calls For Young Thug's Release</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Free thug! Mistrial!" the Zoom hacker shouted repeatedly. Those in the courtroom, including Young Thug, looked <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">collectively shocked</a> by the unexpected interruption. The judge failed to mention the hacker before announcing the break. While plenty of fans find the debacle hilarious, others are urging for the antics to stop, as they have the potential to jeopardize Young Thug's future freedom. If the trial doesn't go as he hopes, the artist could spend the rest of his life behind bars. Needless to say, it's critical at this point for everything to go off without a hitch. "When will people understand you making it worse for bro?" one commenter wonders. "I hope he use that in a song when he get out," another says.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Fans aren't the only ones who want to see the YSL founder back home, either. Earlier this week, his brother shared <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">a heartfelt message</a> for him on Instagram. "I promise god hear us, I wish I can call u and tell u I understand now," he wrote. What do you think of a Zoom hacker interrupting Young Thug's trial? Are you surprised?
