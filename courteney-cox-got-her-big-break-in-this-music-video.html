Well, Courteney Cox's journey is a big different. Her first noteworthy work, even if it was small, is a big part of American culture. Every time fans click play on Bruce Springsteen's 1984 "Dancing in the Dark" on <a href=#>YouTube</a>&nbsp;or elsewhere, they will catch a glimpse of Cox's infectious smile (and witness her killer dance moves made even more spectacular in a muscle tee). Director Brian De Palma, of "Scarface" and "Mission: Impossible" fame, instructed the singer to grab a fan from the audience and bring her onto the stage, per the <a href=#>StarTribune</a>.</p><p>De Palma singled out Cox, but Springsteen thought she was simply a random person. De Palma later told Springsteen that Cox was an actor who had been through a casting call, per the report. "I walked into this big casting room and all these dancers were there. Their legs right up in the air, they're stretching, [doing] splits, and I was like, 'I don't think I'm in the right place because I can barely touch my toes," Cox said during an appearance on&nbsp;<a href=#>"Off Camera with Sam Jones"</a> in 2017.</p><p>Cox was picked with two other girls and Cox was adamant that she should not be the girl to dance onstage, she told Jones. She now laughs about how her career could have turned out if De Palma had listened to her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbnFmaH93e8KorKuslaOyunnCqK9mn5%2Bpeqmx0WaZop9dl7%2BmrcpmoKdlpJ22tHnMrqqim12rtqWxzmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./5-letter-words-ending-in-ng-wordle-game-help.html><span>←</span><span>5 Letter Words Ending in NG - Wordle Game Help</span></a>
