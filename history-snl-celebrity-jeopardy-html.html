But the heart of the sketch has always been the three celebrities who appeared most often: Will Ferrell playing the eternally exhausted Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek, Norm Macdonald as the careless and funny hat-wearing Burt Reynolds, and Darrell Hammond as Sean Connery, who always managed to fit in at least one joke about having sex with Trebek’s mother. “It’s third-grade humor, which is the best kind of humor,” <a href=#>writer-producer Steve Higgins explained to Variety</a> after the <a href=#>death of the real Trebek in November 2020</a>. “People would talk about the sketch and say that the celebrities were dumb. But that wasn’t it. It was that they didn’t care. They just wanted to burn Alex Trebek. And why? Because he’s so unassailably good.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckhfe5sc3007p3h6ahjym101p@published data-word-count=116>There are two stories about the origins of “Celebrity Jeopardy.” The first is from Higgins, who in his 2020 talk with Variety credited his wife for coming up with the initial concept for the sketch in 1996, which led to him co-writing the first installment with Adam McKay. The other comes from Norm Macdonald, who said in his 2015 <a href=#>recap of SNL’s 40th anniversary special</a> that he got the idea for the sketch “by stealing it, note for note, from an SCTV classic, ‘Half-Wits’” after asking Martin Short and Eugene Levy for permission. The definitive origin of the sketch remains unclear, but like the “Celebrity Jeopardy” sketch itself, it’s not easy to find the correct answer.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckhgdqtbu000s3h6faz9chver@published data-word-count=66>Thanks to the impersonation skills of the SNL cast — plus some comedy-writing talent from Higgins, Macdonald, McKay, Mike Schur, Robert Carlock, Erik Kenward, and Seth Meyers over the years — “Celebrity Jeopardy” quickly evolved from a silly one-off sketch to a recurring favorite. “I’m just lucky that I got to be a part of it,” Higgins told Variety. “That’s the best thing I’ve ever done.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckhfbn2mh002w3h6akj94tuj8@published data-word-count=18>Here, for your viewing pleasure, is the complete collection of every “Celebrity Jeopardy” sketch, from start to finish:</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0uymb10g9mx984vmkbjqi7@published data-word-count=4><strong>1.

The categories weren’t as absurdly juvenile as the later sketches (“Potent Potables,” “Movies,” “U.S. History,” “Popular Music”) and Hammond’s Sean Connery was cooperative and inoffensive.

The contestants all start with negative scores, and even though the categories are still a bit dry (“Three Letter Words,” “Colors,” “U.S. States”), the contestants either ramble about unrelated topics or choose non-existent categories, so Trebek has to choose everything for them. This is also the only “Celebrity Jeopardy” sketch where the celebrities mention the charities they’re playing for — Reynolds plays for the Palm Beach Golf and Tennis Resort.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0uymb10g9yx984d3knog0i@published data-word-count=4><strong>3.

Up until now, most of the categories have been pretty standard, but now they get notably stupider with “Words That Rhyme With Dog” and “Shapes,” and from this point forward the sketch brought us some great ones, like “Ponies,” “Foods That End In ‘Amburger,’” and “Black Comedians Named Whoopi.”</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0uymb10ga4x984lmdftcp0@published data-word-count=4><strong>4.

In <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live</a>, Hammond explained that when he first did Sean Connery, “I had a really accurate Sean Connery. Now what I do is really a bastardization of who he is, because it just seems funnier to me and it’s funnier to the writers and it gets more of an audience response. Sometimes they just don’t want to see accuracy, they just want it to be funny.”</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0uymb10gaax984mltefi1d@published data-word-count=4><strong>5.

Already exhausted and annoyed, Trebek presents the categories to the celebrity contestants, which start with the standard “Potent Potables” then evolve into more childlike themes (“Colors That End in -Urple”). All questions clearly give away the answers (“This Number Comes Between Five and Seven,” “This Is The Sound a Doggy Makes”), but the contestants always fail to answer correctly and often fail to even choose a category. Connery turns at least one category into a sexual pun involving semen and/or having sex with Trebek’s mother, and eventually Trebek forces the game into the Final Jeopardy round. At least one of the contestants answers correctly but then makes an untranslatable wager, and Trebek ends the game with references to self-mutilation or suicide.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0uymb10gagx984kx3ewfr2@published data-word-count=4><strong>6.

The main players who inspired the spirit of the sketch might be gone, but one thing is certain: “Celebrity Jeopardy” lives on as an SNL classic forever. Or, as Macdonald put it in 2015, “‘Celebrity Jeopardy’ was about hope. It was about the hope of one man, Alex Trebek, the hope that never died.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckhged4q2001c3h6f3cgs0lje@published data-word-count=6>Here’s to the next 15 sketches.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Thank you, Alex. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ee8bexzvpJ</a></p>— Saturday Night Live - SNL (@nbcsnl) <a href=#>November 9, 2020</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>I first saw him when I was a boy in Ottawa where he hosted Reach For The Top.
