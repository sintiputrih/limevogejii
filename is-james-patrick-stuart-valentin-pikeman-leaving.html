The first half I wrote before Friday’s game-changing episode. I decided it all still worked and to let it stand, but then shift over to how everything changed come Friday, and how it’s a whole new game now!</p><h2>Jason’s Family and Friends Take Sides</h2><p>It was interesting to see who had faith in Jason, and who was shaken. As I commented last week, a lot of viewers felt <a href=# rel=noopener>Sonny should have trusted Jason</a>. However with the facts he had at his disposal, that Jason had stayed gone, was on the roof with the sniper, and Dante was shot, he wasn’t sure what to believe. Coupled with all those close to him who’ve betrayed him lately, I thought it was understandable. I thought the best explanation was when Sonny and Ava talked about Sonny returning home from Nixon Falls to find Jason had gotten together with Carly, and that’s when Sonny’s doubts began to creep in. And oh brother, they aren’t even hinting at this point that something is going to happen between Ava and Sonny. When Kristina told Nina she should reach out to Sonny, I almost envisioned a repeat of Carly walking in on Sonny and Nina in bed together on The Haunted Star!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sonny-carly-argue-jason-gh-abc.jpg alt="Carly screams at SOnny GH" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>More:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Will Jason’s sons forgive him?</a></p><p>Joss’ hypocrisy soared to new heights this week. She went from dumping Dex for almost killing Cyrus, to confronting her mom over what crimes Jason had commited for Sonny in the past (as if she didn’t already know), to this week, standing by Jason’s side proclaiming his innocence. The girl is giving me whiplash! She verbally attacked Kristina over Sonny’s disloyalty and that they were both wrong about Jason, and then told Michael that Sonny didn’t deserve Jason’s loyalty. The only thing she said I agreed with was that Molly prosecuting Jason was a conflict of interest. Otherwise, Dex you are better off without Joss. With the Spring semester about to end, maybe Joss and Trina need to take a long girls’ trip to Europe for the summer! Dex can then work on his PCPD training, which I think we all knew is where this was headed. It’s the only way to keep him safe, especially if he ends up working with Dante.</p><p><strong>More:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Eden McCoy on breaking Cameron’s heart</a></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dex-joss-gh-abc.jpg alt="Dex speaks to Joss GH" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The Danny vs Jake scenes were well done, and poor Aiden was caught in the middle again. He’s always the odd man out between all his extended siblings. However, it was Sam’s fury over Jason letting Danny help him and asking him not to tell Sam that really hit home. Kelly Monaco delivered that takedown of Jason in a Daytime Emmy-worthy performance! Again, a lot of viewers thought she overreacted, but I felt she made her points pretty clear. Sam has had to raise Danny most of his life with Jason presumed dead twice now, he doesn’t know what troubles Danny is dealing with, and he could have gotten Danny into serious legal trouble. The big “Wow!” moment was Sam telling Danny that the trust between her and Jason was finally broken. Also, can these kids look any more the same? Jake is the only one who stands out with his blond hair!</p><p><strong>More:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>ABC’s shortlived drama The City</a></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sam-danny-jason-gh-abc.jpg alt="Sam chats with Danny GH" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>It was interesting that Jason trusted Anna with the truth about Cates over Diane. He could have told Diane she couldn’t use any of what he told her in court, and she’d be obligated to follow her client’s instructions. Of course, the double whammy came when Jason learned he and Cates were once friends when he was Jason Quartermaine, a life he doesn’t remember. I loved that Anna was just as upset over Cates’ manipulation of Jason as he was, and I’m waiting for that confrontation to go down. And normally I’m not a big Jason fan, but even I was touched when he had to take a moment after learning about Britt, and the tears in his eyes when he got Monica’s note that she believed in him.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/blq-jason-gh-abc.jpg alt="BLQ visits Jason GH" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Sonny not showing up to Jason’s hearing was another powerful statement, along with Sam being a no-show. I loved Molly arguing that Jason had a rap sheet longer than a CVS receipt, what a great line. However what judge in their right mind would set bail at all for Jason, let alone a bail the Quartermaine’s could fork over easily. Michael also had a great answer to Joss saying she hoped he brought his checkbook. “Never go to court without it!”</p><p><strong>More:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Josh Kelly supports fellow castmate’s other gig</a></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/molly-argues-court-gh-abc.jpg alt="Molly counters GH" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Friday’s Episode Changed Everything!</h2><p>Boy did <a href=# rel=noopener>Friday’s episode blow up everything</a> we thought we knew was going on! First, let’s start with Valentin and Brennan being in cahoots all these years. Wow, what a game-changing twist. I mean we knew already that Valentin had ties to Pikeman from his WSB days, but not that he was in this deep. I’m glad we got to see Brennan again, and it seems like we haven’t seen the last of him. But Valentin has now stepped up and taken over Pikeman with Brennan in jail. I did not see that one coming! I’m honestly still processing my feelings on this, as I’ve loved Valentin’s redemption arc over the years since his introduction. Now we know he’s always been a little diabolical as Brennan put it. Maybe a lot? It feels like this storyline could sadly lead to Valentin’s exit. It was also interesting that Valentin became irate when Brennan mentioned Anna, wanting her to never find out how involved he is with Pikeman. What about Nina? You are trying to kill her husband! Er, possibly soon-to-be ex-husband?</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/val-brennan-boss-gh-abc.jpg alt="Valentin in charge GH" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Thanks to Valentin revealing his plan for Sonny to his co-conspirator, we now have an explanation for why Sonny has been acting the way he has. Valentin’s arranged for a portion of his bipolar meds to be placebos, so basically, he’s having episodes. This explains his paranoia, his cutting people out of his life left and right, his trust issues, and his trusting in Ava of all people. Carly said all of that in Friday’s episode, “What’s happened to you?” I do find it odd she of all people hasn’t suspected he’s off his meds by now. Maybe she soon will? She laid it all out, he’s becoming manic again, she just hasn’t put two and two together.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/carly-defends-jason-gh-abc_4e7c11.jpg alt="Carly defends Jason to Sonny GH" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Then there is Ava. I can’t believe it, but poor Ava. She too should see the signs given what happened with Morgan. Or is she falling for Sonny and blinded by her feelings? When everything comes out, she’s going to feel like a fool, and this is shades of the whole Kevin/Ryan debacle all over again. Some viewers though already suspect Ava is in on it, and working with Valentin to get rid of Sonny. Why though? Again, Nina has been her only friend, and Sonny is Avery’s father. I just can’t see that playing out. Though I guess we now know there may be a way for Sonny to find himself back with Nina at some point when it’s revealed he’s off his meds. Maybe it will be Nina of all people who question his meds, as she saw his manic episodes firsthand in Nixon Falls.</p><p><strong>More:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Who was John’s brother Stone Cates?</a></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sonny-kisses-ava-gh-abc.jpg alt="Sonny kisses Ava GH" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Hey, What About That Other Guy?</h2><p>My final thought I’ll leave you this week is… with everything we know now… what did Austin and his murder have to do with all of this? Why was Ava sent one of the stolen WSB guns? Why the note sent to her with the Polaroids saying, “You are welcome.” Will the new writing regime just sweep all that and Austin under the rug as if he didn’t exist? Or was it Valentin who did those things, because he and Ava ARE working together, and maybe he bought Wyndemere from her? Hmm, I’ll leave you to ponder that. I have to ponder it too…</p><p>Agree or disagree with my opinions, as always, leave yours in the comments below!</p><p><strong>Before you go, check out the gallery below of the <a href=# rel=noopener>soap actors we’ve lost so far in 2024</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmoJ2emr%2BiuIyhpqyomamurXvSqJipmp%2BtfHh%2Bkm5vbWeZqHqrrcyeqmaokam%2Fqq%2FKZqqtrZGnwW7CwKWcp6yZo3qxtcqepJqmXaGyosLIp55o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./henry-cavills-the-witcher-journey-is-over-but-fans-already-know-which-iconic-character-he-should-play-next.html><span>←</span><span>Henry Cavills The Witcher journey is over, but fans already know which iconic character he</span></a>
