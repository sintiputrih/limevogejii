DeJesus, who has two daughters, Nova, 6, with&nbsp;Devoin Austin, and 5-month-old&nbsp;Stella<strong>&nbsp;</strong>with&nbsp;Luis Hernandez, joined the cast of the MTV series during season 8.</p><p>Marroquin opened up about his potentially being deployed again during the <a href=#>July 18 episode of </a>Teen Mom 2.</p><p>“I just found out that I might need to leave again,” Marroquin, who struggled being away from home during his first deployment, revealed to Lowry. “It’s between me and another guy. He is going through some family stuff so he doesn’t want to take it. I just got home, I don’t want to take it.”</p><p>He ended up not being deployed again until now.</p><p>Marroquin married Lowry in 2013, and the pair announced their split in 2016.

Which I’m blessed for don’t get me wrong. But him, that’s it.”</p><p>“Wow, disappointed in yourself that you let OTHERS influence how you treat the mother of your child, yet here we are again,” the mother of three responded.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatnZWjeq67zGZprGWalsOqecyaqaunoaq2r3nIrGSbnZmjtG6wxKmjqLGVmXqjxYytn55lkZ6%2FbrLOq5qeZZGcrqq6jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sebastian-maniscalco-moves-72k-tickets-at-four-msg-shows.html><span>←</span><span>Sebastian Maniscalco Moves 72K Tickets At Four MSG Shows</span></a>
