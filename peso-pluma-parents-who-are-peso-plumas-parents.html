His father has&nbsp;Lebanese&nbsp;ancestry and was born in&nbsp;Chiapas.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Peso Pluma career</h2><p>In the early years of his life, Pluma picked up the guitar and began honing his skill by penning songs that drew influence from local Mexican music.</p><p>Following two somewhat successful studio albums, Ah y Qué? (2020) and Efectos Secundarios (2021), Pluma collaborated with Raul Vega on “El Belicón” (2022), which sold 480,000 copies and earned an 8× Platinum Latin certification from the RIAA.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/14105442/1-4-1024x576.jpg><p>He continued to follow up his breakthrough with the extended play Sembrando and the controversial 5× Platinum Latin-certified duet “Siempre Pendientes” with Luis R. Conriquez, which entered the Billboard Global 200.</p><p>His two duets with Natanael Cano, “AMG” (featuring Gabito Ballesteros) and “PRC,” charted on the Billboard Hot 100 and were huge hits in the Latin music world after being used on TikTok.</p><p>“Ella Baila Sola” by Pluma and Eslabon Armado, which peaked at number four, made history in April by being the first regional Mexican song to crack the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p>The song’s commercial success increased the singer’s profile globally and, in the week of April 29, 2023, eight of her songs were placed on the Hot 100, making her the Mexican artist with the most Spanish-language entries in the US.</p><p>According to Spotify, the song was the fifth most streamed music globally by the end of 2023. Génesis (2023), his third studio album, took home the Grammy for Best Música Mexicana Album (including Tejano).</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Pluma is regarded as a key figure in the resurgence of corridos because of her unique musical style, which is dominated by corridos tumbados (Sinaloa-style sierreño corridos with elements of Latin urban music, notably Latin hip hop and reggaeton). Pluma is the most streamed musician of all time in Mexico thanks to his international popularity.</p><p>The song “Pixelados” from Luis R. Conriquez’s album Corridos Bélicos, Vol. IV, which was released on January 4, 2024, is the result of Peso Pluma’s and Conriquez’s third collaboration together.</p><p>Peso Pluma’s purported promotion of narcoculture has drawn criticism for the artist’s admission to the 2024 Viña del Mar International Song Festival, according to public intellectual Alberto Mayol of Chile.</p><p>René Lues, the councilor of Viña del Mar, issued an open letter to Alcalde Macarena Ripamonti requesting that she remember Peso Pluma’s invitation to the festival, citing Mayol.</p><p>Subsequently, Peso Pluma’s invitation was criticized by Chilean ministers of the interior and justice, Carolina Tohá and Luis Cordero Vega.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/14105247/peso-pluma-photo-by-mike-coppola-getty-images-for-mtv-1024x576.jpg><p>The worldwide press has extensively highlighted Peso Pluma’s criticism and possible cancellation. The vocalist would additionally appear on “Igual Que Un Ángel” alongside Kali Uchis, which was made available on January 12, 2024, alongside Uchis’s fourth studio album, Orquídeas.</p><p>Additionally, Pluma and Christian Nodal would work together on “La Intención,” which was published on January 25, 2024.</p><p><strong>Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>www.Ghgossip.com</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqmcrKddpbm2ucBmp5qqlaPBtHnWoaZmmaKaerGx0qhkqaSloq60ec%2BaqZ6mpKh8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mark-holcomb-net-worth-168110.html><span>←</span><span>Mark Holcomb Net Worth</span></a>
