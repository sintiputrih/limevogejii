That has been one of the issues raised when it comes to the new and disturbing trend of deepfaking individuals to look as if they are partaking in pornographic acts. Now, a <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitch</a></strong> streamer, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokimane</a></strong>, who has found herself a victim of just this, has one very simple, clear response.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=486 data-current-count=486 data-injectable=true>Twitch streamer Atrioc accidentally exposed his own wrongdoing after ending a game he was streaming and allowing viewers to see the tabs he had open on his screen, one of which was of a site that had deepfake pornographic content. The website featured deepfakes of fellow female streamers such as Pokimane and Maya Higa. Though the streamer quickly switched tabs without trying to draw attention to it, it was too late: screengrabs were taken, and, as we know, the internet is forever.</p><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Atrioc has since then issued a tearful apology</a>, stating that this is not a pattern of behavior. Rather, he claimed that he fell down an A.I. rabbit hole at 2 a.m. one morning and ended up on the site, which charges $15 a month. What makes this even creepier is that he is actually friends with some of the women featured on the site, with some having already responded.</p><h2 id=h-pokimane-s-comments-on-the-deepfake-controversy data-injectable=false>Pokimane’s comments on the deepfake controversy</h2><p data-characters=151 data-current-count=520 data-injectable=true>Now, Twitch streamer Pokimane is adding her response to the disturbing story, and she has one very clear and straightforward message, so pay attention.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>stop sexualizing people without their consent.</p><p>that’s it, that’s the tweet.</p>— pokimane (@pokimanelol) <a href=#>January 31, 2023</a></figure><h2 id=h-here-s-why-the-deepfake-controversy-matters-and-what-other-streamers-had-to-say-about-it data-injectable=false>Here’s why the deepfake controversy matters and what other streamers had to say about it</h2><p data-characters=470 data-current-count=770 data-injectable=true>Female streamers are finding themselves consistently sexualized without their consent, as is the case here. They are often harassed simply for having the “audacity” to be a woman within the streaming community, and this is just one more way that they are denied their basic humanity by having these deepfakes of themselves in a sexually explicit manner put out on the internet, with very little they can do about it given the legal grey area they fall into.</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=280 data-injectable=false>One such victim, QTCinderella, filmed an emotional message about how these deepfakes have affected her and that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she has committed to suing the website creator</a>. Another creator, SweetAnita, also expressed her distress after discovering, via a tweet, that she was also on the site.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=580 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>This story was how I found out that I'm on this website. I literally choose to pass up millions by not going into sex work and some random cheeto encrusted porn addict solicits my body without my consent instead. Don't know whether to cry, break stuff or laugh at this point. <a href=#>https://t.co/voNoxRyVBd</a></p>— Sweet Anita (@sweetanita) <a href=#>January 30, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=213 data-injectable=false>These women did not consent to having their images used this way, and as Sweet Anita states in the following tweet, “I just don’t think this should be the price for wanting to entertain people.”</p><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=501 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vice</a> has since reported that the site Ewing used has since been scrubbed of deepfakes, and the creator has left a lengthy apology, calling the videos “immoral.” The legal issues surrounding this type of personal invasion are murky, but some states have made a little headway.</p><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=242 data-injectable=false>Though there are laws against non-consensual sexual material, only California, Virginia, and Texas specifically address deepfakes. Given that it is the internet, however, getting any form of reparation can be extremely difficult for victims.</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=false>If you or someone you know has been a victim of non-consensual pornography, more information on how you can get help can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">https://cybercivilrights.org/ccri-safety-center/#document</a> or call the CCRI Image Abuse Helpline at 1-844-878-2274, which is available free of charge, 24/7.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S9sLfIppinnV2nsrS8zqebrGWkpHqiwNGippxllJqysbLApJxmm5%2BjwbO71Z6prLFdrLa1tIyopZ5lo566sbjEZqmeqaWawLV7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lucian-piane.html><span>←</span><span>Lucian Piane</span></a>
