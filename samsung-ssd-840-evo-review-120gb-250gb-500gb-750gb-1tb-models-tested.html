<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Final Words - Samsung SSD 840 EVO Review: 120GB, 250GB, 500GB, 750GB &amp;amp; 1TB Models Tested</h1></header><section class=post-content><h2>Final Words</h2><p>I was extremely excited about <a href=#>Crucial's M500</a> because it was the first reasonably priced ~1TB SSD. Even though its performance wasn't class leading, it was honestly good enough to make the recommendation a no-brainer. The inclusion of features like eDrive support were just the icing on the cake. With the EVO, Samsung puts forth a formidable competitor to the M500. It's faster, uses less power at idle and carries lower MSRPs for most of the capacity range. Microsoft's eDrive standard isn't supported at launch, but Samsung expects to change that via a firmware update this September.</p><p>Endurance isn't a concern with TLC for client workloads, although I wouldn't recommend deploying the EVO in a write heavy database server or anything like that.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img height=514 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/reviews/storage/Samsung/840EVO/DSC_1051sm.jpg width=678 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The additional features that Samsung threw in the pot this round really show some innovative thinking. TurboWrite does a good job of blurring the lines between MLC and TLC performance, while Samsung's RAPID DRAM cache offers adventurous users a way of getting a taste of high-end PCIe SSD performance out of an affordable TLC SATA drive.</p><p>The 1TB version is exciting because it offers a competitive price with the 960GB M500 but with better performance. It's also good to have an alternative there as the 960GB M500 has been supply constrained at times. At first I didn't believe that Samsung's TLC strategy could hold weight against the Intel/Micron approach of aggressively pursuing smaller process nodes with MLC NAND, but the EVO does a lot to change my opinion. I'd have no issues with one of these drives in my system even as primary storage. The performance story is really good (particularly with the larger capacities), performance consistency out of the box is ok (and gets better if you can leave more free space on the drive) and you've got Samsung's firmware expertise supporting you along the way as well.</p><p align=center><img height=195 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/reviews/storage/Samsung/840EVO/Recommended.png width=450 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>To say that I really like the EVO is an understatement. If Samsung can keep quantities of the 840 EVO flowing, and keep prices at or below its MSRP, it'll be a real winner and probably my pick for best mainstream SSD.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIRyg5Joqpqlo6q7qHnSrJtmcGRleqbCzmapnq6ZmsRufZFpnptlYmp9qK6Mbmdpn5JihHZ8xptkaqySYrqwsMSlqmaslajBprCOamk%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./does-mary-kay-mccall-is-the-younger-sister-of-joanna-gaines-net-worth-age-height-bio.html><span>←</span><span>Does Mary Kay McCall is the younger sister of Joanna Gaines?
