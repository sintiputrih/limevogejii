The two also had plans to open a new restaurant together. Watts-Richardson claimed after he took Brown's son for a sleepover and the mother never called that night to speak with him or check on her son. Brown was supposed to pick up Noah from a bus stop the next day (January 4) but she never arrived. “I put Noah on the bus the next day,” Watts-Richardson told <a href=# rel=nofollow>10 Philadelphia</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Watts-Richardson said he doesn't know what happened to Brown between January 3 and January 4. “I have nothing to do with anything,” Watts-Richardson said. “Just because I’m the last person to see her, that does not mean anything. It seems like I’m being the one poked at,” fumed Watts-Richardson said. “And it’s frustrating because I’m the first person that was the one calling the police, trying to kick down windows. Trying to find my friend. Trying to make sure her son is covered,” he added.</p><p>“She was a devoted mother of an 8-year-old boy, and by all accounts, she would have never left him unattended or unsupervised,” said Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele. Brown's "vehicle was parked outside of her home, and her car keys, wallet, purse and work cell phone were found inside," the day she failed to pick up her son. Authorities also pointed out that Brown's personal phone was inactive and hadn't been started since Wednesday morning. Subsequently, her phone was not discovered when police found her body. “She is a doting, I call her, helicopter mom. She loves her son. She would never leave her son,” Tiffany Barron, Brown’s best friend, said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRomZ6pvK%2B1zmaumqykqHqztcKhmKuco6S7brjArKtmqJWnwLC6jK2mZquVmnqrsc2noJ%2BdomKvs7vWp2SapJmrsm6wxKegnqtdnru3u8uvnKadnql6qrqMnZyarJg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./trevian-kuttis-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>What Is Trevian Kuttis Net Worth?</span></a>
