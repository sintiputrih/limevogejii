Either way, something about this performance had fans wanting her to reconnect a little more with some more... traditional values. Moreover, the Bronx rapper recently posted a good old King James Bible on her Instagram Story, which a fan gave to her after this concert. Of course, this falls in line with the sometimes misogynist and often controlling view that people have on how femcees should act and what they should promote.</p><p>If it wasn't clear by now, then we don't know what could convince you that she's not here for any of that. Also, it's worth noting that Ice Spice is also <a href=# rel>still getting used to the massive amount of fame she got</a> in what feels like record time. After all, when you're still traveling all the time and barely have time to settle down, it can be tough to think about how you want to present yourself and not giving into others' wishes. So take that Bible with as much or as little energy as you want, Princess Diana; we won't blame you.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=# rel>Ice Spice Hits Back Hard On Tweet Calling Her Out</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ice-spice-laughs-at-bible-that-fan-gave-her-after-show>Ice Spice Laughs At Bible That Fan Gave Her After Show</h2></span><p>Furthermore, it's also hard to break away from successful formulas when even <a href=# rel>one of the Internet's most popular current muses</a> is lusting after you. Rubi Rose recently took to Twitter to thirst for Ice Spice, tweeting on Sunday (October 29) that she's "sexy as f**k." If you know anything about the Kentucky rhymer, it's that people online shoot these same comments at her all the time. Real recognize real once again, or at least she's acknowledging that the Like..? hitmaker deserves the confidence and satisfaction she feels.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rubi-rose-is-head-over-heels-for-the-munch-mc>Rubi Rose Is Head Over Heels For The "Munch" MC</h2></span><p>Meanwhile, we'll see what else these two get up to when it comes to their careers in 2024. They had a pretty big year for different reasons, but ones that they'll surely capitalize on moving forward. Let's just hope fans drop the "fix yourself" act and see them for who they truly are: artists, not mannequins.
