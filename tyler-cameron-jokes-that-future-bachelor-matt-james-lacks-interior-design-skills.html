Cameron handled his room and the shared public spaces, while James, 28, focused on his own bedroom. And while the large furniture pieces James picked out were totally normal, Cameron says it’s the way he decided to decorate the rest of his room that made it, well, a little unique.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I think it's like a jungle theme that just never pans out,” the Florida-native says with a laugh of his friend’s aesthetic. “It's really one that we've still got to work on.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“He wanted lions and hyenas, but then he also wanted pancakes,” Cameron says of the wall decor James put up. “So he has photos of animals on the wall, he has photos of breakfast food going … then randomly, he has a jersey from middle school hanging up. I'm like, ‘Dude, what is going on in here.’”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I was like, ‘Matt, when did this come together? It doesn't make sense,’" Cameron continues, claiming James told him, “You’ve just got to see it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: Bachelor Nation Calls for More Diversity As Fans Get to Know First Black Male Lead Matt James</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">No matter his eye for design, Cameron says living with James is a blast. Due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the roommates temporarily relocated to Cameron’s family home in Jupiter earlier this year.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The last time we were both there together was probably in March or February,” Cameron says of their apartment, admitting that he misses living in the big city “so much it hurts.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Cameron and James's living room.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Brown Bear Visuals</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“But we have so much fun there together,” Cameron says. “Our building has such great amenities, so we're always either playing basketball or swimming or working out together, or we're cooking up some great food.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">James and Cameron became close while <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>playing football together at Wake Forest University</a>, and the pair now work together at the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>charity ABC Food Tours</a>, which James founded.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The non-profit is designed to teach underprivileged New York City youth about how to lead healthy, active lifestyles while giving them a chance to try new restaurants in their communities. Cameron and James even invited students from one of the schools they visited over for a Thanksgiving dinner last November.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">ABC <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>announced James as The Bachelor's next leading man</a> on June 12, making him the franchise's first-ever Black male lead. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Rachel Lindsay</a> made history as the first Black Bachelorette on season 13 in 2017.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">James was previously cast as one of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Clare Crawley</a>'s <i>Bachelorette</i> contestants.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5ikuqZ707KjnqpdmK6usdGopWain6CytHnToZitZZaqwba%2BxGaZmpuYmrmwvoymmK2sXZ%2BurrHSZqOam5uoeqq6056poqeiYrGmv8igpWarm565rb%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sarah-sanders-bio-facts-wiki-net-worth-age-height-family-huckabee-trump-red-hen-restaurant-acosta-husband-resignation-father-eye.html><span>←</span><span>Sarah Sanders Bio, Facts, Wiki, Net Worth, Age, Height, Family, Huckabee, Trump, Red Hen, Restau</span></a>
