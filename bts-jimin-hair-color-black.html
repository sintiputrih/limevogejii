And in the band's last music video, he had colored hair (purple, lavender, pink, take your pick). So, it was a shock to see him go to the opposite end of the color spectrum without taking a few stops between. Back in May 2019, when the band was embarking on its North American tour, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Allure </a>reported that he'd gone back to black just a week after showing up to the Billboard Music Awards with a peachy-coral hue. With that return to his roots, the term "Jimin has black hair" made it to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Twitter's top trends</a> in Malaysia, the U.S., South Korea, and Austria. The more recent reveal hasn't jumped into the Twitter ether just yet, but it's only a matter of time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And as for Jimin's barista skills, fans described the entire process as chaotic, since the two Korean crooners were doing everything by hand.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the end, they decided that ordering delivery was easier than manual labor and for many of the people who've tried their hand at making the viral sip, let's just say that Jimin and RM aren't exactly wrong.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeSqcButsimoKdlmJa2s3nCqKOoql2XuaKvyg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./be-quiet-introduces-new-flagship-silent-base-900-chassis.html><span>←</span><span>Be Quiet!
