She has appeared in movies like 2005's Pride & Prejudice,&nbsp;2008's&nbsp;Eden Lake, 2009's Sherlock Holmes,&nbsp;and 2012's&nbsp;Flight. She landed her role as Beth Dutton on the hit series&nbsp;Yellowstone in 2018 — at last, her first real breakout role.</p><p>The&nbsp;star told <a href=#>Parade</a> in 2018 that she enjoys playing the enigmatic Beth Dutton, though the fan-favorite character sometimes doesn't make the best decisions. Reilly said, "She's probably the most self-loathing character that I've ever played. It's like she's turned all that pain into darkness, so that's who she is."</p><p>Per&nbsp;<a href=#>Variety</a>,&nbsp;Yellowstone was renewed for Season 4 shortly before the premiere of the third season.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2pmaX16e8Geq6Fllqe8rnnYnqOlp6eowbC6xGabopyeqXqiuNaasKxlnKS8rHnLoqKeZaSdtrR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./abby-pollock-net-worth-280108.html><span>←</span><span>Abby Pollock Net Worth</span></a>
