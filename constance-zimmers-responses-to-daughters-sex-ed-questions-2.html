So then she tells me and I go, ‘Yeah, okay, that’s pretty right.’ And I don’t need to go into something else.”</p><p>The actress added: “Her biggest issue has been, ‘Do I have to do that?’ … I’m always like, ‘No, you don’t.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Constance-Zimmer-Sex-Ed.jpg><p>Zimmer&nbsp;has “open conversations” with the preteen about her body and what is and isn’t normal, which she wishes someone had talked to her about in her youth.</p><p>The Washington native welcomed Colette in 2008 with her&nbsp;husband, director<strong>&nbsp;Russ Lamoureux</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>With a long list of roles on successful roles from UnREAL to <a href=#>Entourage</a>, Zimmer&nbsp;is looking forward to her next project, which hasn’t been announced yet.</p><p>“I’m so proud of the characters I’ve played and the women that I’ve portrayed,” she told Us on Friday. “They’re so strong and they’re so unfiltered and I want to stay in that realm, but I want to always try and figure out a way to reinvent it. And so this [new role] feels like a really fun combination of Agents of Shield and Unreal and Entourage&nbsp;kind of all thrown together.”</p><p>With reporting by Antonia Blyth</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGacp56owaK6wp5ks6GdorKzv4yrnKyon6PApr%2BMraZmnJGqtKnAxKuqZquVrXqmsIyqrJ6rpJ68r7%2BMa2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-bollywood-psychological-thriller-movies.html><span>←</span><span>5 Bollywood Psychological Thriller Movies That Are A Must-Watch</span></a>
