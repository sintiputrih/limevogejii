The decision was unanimous. During Week 6, lovebirds Shelli Poole and Clay Honeycutt found themselves both on the chopping block, all thanks to reigning HoH James. Later, Clay and Shelli’s worst case scenario came to fruition, as<a rel=nofollow href=#> James won the Power of Veto</a> and announced in the POV ceremony that he would not be using it. With the nominations kept the same, their fates were sealed – and one of them would be heading home.</p><p>At the beginning of Week 6, Clay Honeycutt basically threw in the towel and informed some of the other houseguests to save Shelli, and volunteered to be evicted as a true martyr. However, as the days went by, Big Brother spoilers from the live feeds revealed that Clay had a change of heart, and he sat down with Austin and tried to cut a deal behind Shelli’s back. Austin seemed genuinely interested in keeping Clay and sending Shelli home – so he began working on the twins for their votes. Meanwhile, the BB17 house manipulator <a rel=nofollow href=#>Vanessa campaigned hard against Clay and wanted Shelli to stay</a> in the Big Brother season 17 house.</p><p>So what lead to the showmance’s demise? Clay Honeycutt and Shelli Poole should have laid low and dialed down their showmance: their cuddle sessions put huge bullseyes on their backs from day one. If James hadn’t nominated Shelli and Clay for eviction, someone else in the house would have – it’s a common theme in Big Brother strategies to separate showmances before they morph into final two alliances. The fact that Shelli and Clay single-handedly ousted their own alliance also didn’t exactly help their case any.</p><p>What do you make of tonight’s ultimate eviction decision? We’d love to hear your thoughts in the comments section below! Stay tuned for more BB17 spoilers, gossip, new, recaps, and updates.
