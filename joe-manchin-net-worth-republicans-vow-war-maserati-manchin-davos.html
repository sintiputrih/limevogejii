The 75-year-old conservative appears to be his party's only candidate to retain the West <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Virginia</a> Senate seat, and the ad is apparently intended to discourage him from running. The ad states, "Life's very good for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Democrat</a> Joe Manchin. While West Virginians get stuck with higher prices, smaller paychecks, open borders." The ad includes the phrase "Joe Manchin, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Biden</a>, living it up" and a picture of clinking champagne glasses.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>What is Service Restoration Act?

It said, "Instead of working in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">West Virginia</a>, Joe Manchin is hanging out in Switzerland."</p><p>Manchin has remained quiet about his intentions for 2024, although he hinted on Sunday, January 22, that he might run for president.

Machin, however, said he would not run for governor, which he held from 2005 to 2010.</p><h2 class=split>What is Joe Manchin's net worth?</h2><p>Joe Manchin is projected to have a net worth of $8 million and an annual salary of $700,000 in 2023, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Fimlysiyappa</a>. His main source of income is the emoluments he receives from the United States as a Senator.</p><p>Manchin also generates income through the company he founded in 1988. In addition, he has financial backing from Emerald Coast Realty, which operates a La Quinta in Elkview, West Virginia. The Manchin Docks houseboat in Washington, DC, was reportedly purchased in 2014 for $220,000; its market value is $700,000. Enersystems accounts for 30 per cent of Machin's net worth and 71 per cent of his investment income.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoop%2Baeq6tzZyfoqZdo7K1edaoqa2gXaeyscHBpaCcmZ6oere71maumqpdoq60sdGaq6JlnZa7pLTIp2SdmaakwA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-miguel-sano.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened to Miguel Sano?</span></a>
