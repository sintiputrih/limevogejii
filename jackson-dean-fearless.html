Songs from Greenbroke&nbsp;(2022) allude to hard times and&nbsp;the pull of wild horses. "Fearless" may or may not be based on his experiences (Luke Dick and Jonathan Scott Sherwood are cowriters), but the 22-year-old has no problem convincing us it was. That kind of storytelling at such a young age is dangerous is the very best of ways.</p><p><strong>Did You Know?</strong>:&nbsp;When "<a href=#>Don't Come Lookin</a>'" hit No. 1 on the Mediabase chart, Dean became the youngest, male solo artist ever to hit No. 1 with a debut single.</p><h3>Listen to Jackson Dean's "Fearless":</h3><h3>Jackson Dean's "Fearless" Lyrics:</h3><p>I believe in ghosts, most people don't / I swear it on my grandpa's grave / I've seen 'em in the trees / I've seen 'em in my dreams / And I still can't stay away / My heart wants to wonder / Here and over yonder / I let you come along and take it / And maybe you're the right one / The right by my side one / Or maybe you're the one that's gonna break it.</p><p><strong>Chorus:</strong><br>'Cause I'm fearless / I'll jump off the ledges / Burn all the bridges, walk on the edges / I'm fearless / I don't mind the shadows / Take all the arrows, ride in the echoes / And I don't mind the night / I don't mind the fight, even if I lose / I got thick skin, I'll dive in, I'm fearless / Except when it comes to you.</p><p>So baby, here I am, in the palm of your hand / You got me where you want and you know it / You're lookin' right am me / You're holdin' all the keys / And I don't even care where we're goin’.</p><p><strong>Repeat Chorus</strong></p><p>I can be a loner, a dog without a home / Or wild like the wild things are / I don't scare easy, as long as you keep me / Square in the middle of your arms.</p><p><strong>Repeat Chorus</strong></p><p>When it comes to you / When it comes to you.</p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Next: See This Month's Top 40 Country Songs</a><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter" readability=2><p><span class=visually-hidden>attachment-Fearless Jackson Dean</span></p>Big Machine Records<p>loading...</p></figure><h2 class=photogallery-title>Top 22 Country Songs of 2022, Ranked</h2>There are plenty of feel-good country jams on this list of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">top country songs of 2022</a>, but the No. 1 song is one of the best love songs of the decade. These 22 songs are ranked by critical acclaim, radio and sales success, and importance to the genre.Seven of the 22 artists made our <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Top Country Songs list from 2021</a>, as well, but there are no song repeats. If a song made a previous list (or didn't spend most of its time on the charts in 2022), it's not eligible. So, before you ask where your favorite song is (i.e. Cody Johnson, "'Til You Can't"), be sure the miss isn't just a technicality.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo5mToMCwuoydnJqmXZuyor7LnqqsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./allison-gollust-bio-age-salary-net-worth-wikipedia-wedding-college.html><span>←</span><span>Allison Gollust Bio, Age, Salary, Net Worth, Wikipedia, Wedding, College</span></a>
