And while many people think of a pharmacy as where we get prescriptions and pick up refills, it’s so much more.<strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#> Adam Porath</a></strong>, vice president of pharmacy services at Renown, discusses five benefits of switching to a <strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Renown Pharmacy</a></strong>.&nbsp;</p><h2>1. Hospital Integration</h2><p>With the Meds-to-Beds Program, the Renown Health Pharmacy delivers prescriptions to patients on the floor when they leave the hospital. Another thing that is interesting about the pharmacy is its integration with providers. So, if there is a problem with your prescription, the Renown Pharmacy can get hold of your provider right away. We also can see your lab results and make sure that the dose you are prescribed is the right one.</p><h2>2. On-Site Vaccinations</h2><p>The Renown Health Pharmacy has a private consultation area to administer vaccines on-site. Their team routinely stocks more than a dozen vaccines, and you can call either location (Regional: 775-982-7737 and Locust Street: 775-982-5280) to see if what you're looking for is in stock. Appointments are available in <strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>MyChart</a></strong>.</p><h2>3. Compounding Services</h2><p>Only a fraction of pharmacies in the United States provides compounding services. In the Reno/Sparks area, there are just a few and Renown Pharmacy is one of them.&nbsp;Traditional retail pharmacies take drugs received from a drug manufacturer and put them into a smaller container in the individual amount that the doctor prescribed for a patient. A compounding pharmacy provides medications that are not available commercially.</p><p>For example, a doctor has prescribed a dose that is smaller than what is commercially available. Compounding the medication will provide the dosage as prescribed. Another example could be a child who can’t take a tablet. The pharmacy may be able to use compounding to convert medications into something that is the child can take.</p><h3 class="title title-font-size-03 bold">Renown Pharmacy</h3><p>Explore Renown's retail pharmacy, including prescription transfer, vaccinations, locations and accepted insurances.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.renown.org/-/media/Project/Renown/RenownHealth/Homepage/Images/Promo-Banners/BlogPromo_Pharmacy_880x495.jpg alt="Renown Health Pharmacy" width=880 height=495 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>4.
