But what really caught everyone's eye was a pair of statement pearl earrings she's never worn before. The posts, which featured a massive pearl in the middle surrounded by three leafs at the top, looked strikingly similar to a diamond-and-pearl brooch that once belonged to Queen Elizabeth. The late monarch was last spotted wearing the special jewelry piece on her 73rd birthday in South Korea.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kate rounded out her Remembrance Day look with black gloves, a polished side bun, and smoky eye makeup.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The night before, during the&nbsp;annual Festival of Remembrance at Royal Albert Hall, the Duchess of Cambridge paid tribute to Queen Elizabeth again with her choice in jewelry.&nbsp;At the event, Kate wore her grandmother-in-law's favorite three-strand pearl necklace, as well as her diamond-and-pearl drop earrings. The pieces were the perfect addition to Kate's all-black ensemble, which consisted of a midi-length dress with a high neckline and long sleeves.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57ypqrnmWdnrGluMStpqdlnprEbrzEmqmlZZWWv7O1zaCqZqull8GtsYynpp1loaqyprqMnqOispGXsrW0jHFraWhoZYM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./josh-coghlan-missing.html><span>←</span><span>Josh Coghlan Missing: What Happened to Josh Coghlan?
