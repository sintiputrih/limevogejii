That undoubtedly applies to Drew Gilpin Faust’s latest book, Growing Up at Midcentury: Necessary Trouble, penned by the late Harvard University president. The last thing Faust wants her readers to consider is the fact that she made history by becoming the first woman to govern Harvard.</p><p>The front cover of Necessary Trouble features a close-up of Faust, who was 19 years old at the time, relaxing on the grass of Bryn Mawr College and looking closely at the photographer through his bulky glasses. In the 1960s, Faust would define herself by her role in the civil rights movement, and the photo was shot around the time she was changing from a young woman in a wealthy Virginia family to a political activist.</p><p>Explaining why her wealthy background and education at Concord Academy and Bryn Mawr College did not lead her to the traditional life she intended to embrace is what Faust cares about in Necessary Trouble. She might write about how she became the 28th president of Harvard and oversaw the institution’s extraordinary growth from 2007 to 2018 in a future book.</p><p>Faust takes great pleasure in betraying her class, using the word used to describe President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the New Deal era. The title of the book is taken from a statement made in 2020 by civil rights pioneer and later Faust friend John Lewis in honor of the 55th anniversary of the Selma-to-Montgomery Voting Rights March.</p><p>From an early age, Faust became aware of the subtle bigotry that pervaded her Virginia neighborhood. The younger Faust made life simpler for her parents (her mother never learned to cook) by calling the Black maids by their first names and expecting them to use a separate bathroom behind the kitchen.</p><p>In 1955–1956, the Montgomery Bus Boycott compelled Faust to reflect on how entrenched racism was in America. In a letter she addressed to President Eisenhower in the fifth grade, she expressed her opinion that segregation was contrary to Christian beliefs. She wrote, “Even though I’m nine years old and white, I feel strongly about segregation.</p><p>The contrast between Faust’s wealthy upbringing and the racism she experienced when she left home to attend Concord Academy in Massachusetts four years later was the same. Concord was, in Faust’s words, a “bubble for white Anglo-Saxon Protestants,” but it was also a bubble she tried to escape from. Twenty Concord students, including Faust, boarded a bus to attend a speech by Martin Luther King Jr. at the nearby Groton School.</p><p>Faust had become even more skeptical of the moral norms of the society she was studying when she applied to Bryn Mawr College in 1964. absolutely true. Despite being a highly intelligent women’s college, Bryn Mawr tolerated a pervasive prejudice similar to the one Faust encountered growing up. At Bryn Mawr, uniformed maids served meals to the students, while porters—also Black like the maids—performed the heavy lifting throughout the campus. The maids lived on the upper floor of the residence halls, while the porters lived in the basement.</p><p><strong>Also Read :</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Mackenzie Shirilla Wikipedia, Wiki, Car Video, Instagram, Reddit, Story, What Happened</a></li><li><a href=#>Lori Poland Wiki, Wikipedia, Story, Colorado, Movie, Book</a></li><li><a href=#>Mola Lenghi Wikipedia, Wiki, Shirtless, Spouse, Partner, Bio, Wife, Wedding, Married</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmignpe0tnrNnqtonKKaxG6zyKWnoqZdm662v9No</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cucumber-gazpacho.html><span>←</span><span>Cucumber Gazpacho</span></a>
