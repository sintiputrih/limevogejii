The comedy drama about a football coach who winds up in England managing a middling soccer team has got people talking about some very important things (and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">some slightly funnier stuff, too</a>) – from mental health to the lack of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">out gay players in men’s professional sports</a>. The most recent topic the feel-good show has decided to take a crack at is the ethics of leaked celebrity nudes, as well as when it’s a good idea to delete pictures you may have of former significant others.</p><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=360 data-injectable=false>The storyline concerns Keeley (Juno Temple) having an old, raunchy video resurfacing after a mass hack, reminiscent of the 2014 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">celebrity nude leak</a> that creeps on Reddit immediately and grossly dubbed “the fappening” (in the show, this is reworked to ‘the awankening – something I hate as a concept but love as a fan of terrible wordplay).</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=660 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Who TF LEAKED KEELEY’S NUDES??

However, there is one scene that takes place in Richmond F.C.’s locker room that has plenty of people talking, and it involves the players discussing when it’s ok to keep pictures and videos of a sexual nature that have been sent to you, and when it’s time to delete them. With smartphones now owned by the vast majority of people, these sorts of questions need to be discussed in public. After all, creating and distributing copies of a nude photo once took a fax machine or plenty of money for printing, whereas now all it takes is the push of a button.</p><p data-characters=450 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=true>There’s no doubt the dialogue in this scene was pretty instructive and basic (with a few clichés thrown in for good measure), but the sentiment was heartfelt and the message was clear, which isn’t too surprising in a show that is happy to take a moral stance. And, while people can argue all day about how realistic the moment was, the fact is that it has made some people sit back and reflect on what they’ve kept on their phones.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ted Lasso this week did feel clunky in its execution of what was essentially a PSA on not leaking nudes.
