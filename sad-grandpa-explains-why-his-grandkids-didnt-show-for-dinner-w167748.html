Love him.”</p><p>The Norman, Oklahoma, native noted that his grandkids promised to make it up to him, adding that 20-year-old Brock recently took him to a baseball game to watch another one of his grandchildren play.</p><p>“So I sit down and get a plate, but he waits because he wanted to make sure everyone else got plenty,” Kelsey explained to BuzzFeed. “Well, about 30 minutes pass, and he decides he’ll eat just one. An hour goes by and nobody shows. I could tell he was disappointed, but I made sure to stick around and hang out with him. We had a really great time. I could tell he was disappointed … he even made homemade ice cream, our favorite as kids.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>Her original tweet has since received more than 164,000 retweets and 268,000 likes.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasmZRitLOtzZ2nmmWVrb2trcinqmavmK56qbXSZp6rmZ6ZuKqw0mabopyeqXq0tM6wZJ%2BnomKxqrrNnqlmr2FrhHiAl2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hyun-bin-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Hyun Bin Net Worth</span></a>
