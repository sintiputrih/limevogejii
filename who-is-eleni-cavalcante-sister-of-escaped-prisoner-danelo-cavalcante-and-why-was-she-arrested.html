During the trial, Francisco Lima, Eleni Cavalcante’s boyfriend, testified and revealed a connection that would later play a pivotal role in the unfolding drama. Lima testified that Danelo had given him money to deliver to Eleni. This raised suspicions about her potential knowledge of her brother’s activities.</p><p>On August 21, 2023, Danelo Cavalcante managed to escape from Chester County Prison by leaving authorities in a race against time to locate him. Despite a thorough search of a wooded area near the prison, there was no sign of the escapee. It was believed that Cavalcante had fled the vicinity in a stolen van, adding another layer of complexity to the case.</p><h4><strong>Arrest of Eleni Cavalcante</strong></h4><p>The turning point in this case occurred when officials discovered that Danelo Cavalcante was attempting to contact two former co-workers.
