Schulz, 40, took to the stage at Los Angeles’ Kia Forum on Sunday, May 5, to take jabs at the NFL legend and his friends, but it was the comedian’s joke about host Kevin Hart that drew the biggest response.
“I know Bill Belichick showed up late,” Schulz began, “but don’t worry, I’m sure he has somebody secretly recording this so he can watch the whole thing later."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Diddy and Hart have long been known to be friends.</p><p>After Schulz’s joke, the Netflix cameras decided not to show Hart, who had been seen laughing hysterically at Schulz’s set up until that point.</p><p>Hart introduced Schulz’s set by acknowledging the fact that Schulz had just sold out Madison Square Garden, which Hart joked is “pretty good for a guy who looks like he works at Olive Garden.”</p><p>Once Schulz took the mic, he thanked Hart for the introduction, calling him “the hardest-working guy in Hollywood outside of the PR guy from Nickelodeon,” a reference to allegations made in the <a href=#>recent docuseries<i> Quiet on Set</i></a>.</p><p>Despite some perceived awkwardness after the Diddy joke, it was obvious that Hart was able to roll with the punches.</p><p>“Goddamnit, Andrew Schulz. Worth the goddamn hype, man,” Hart said at the conclusion of Schulz’s set. “You’ll be hearing his name a lot more and more, and it’s deserved.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Hart concluded, “It was great, I gotta be honest with you. It was f–kin’ great.”</p><p>The night also <a href=#>featured sets</a> from comedians including <strong>Nikki Glaser</strong> and <strong>Jeff Ross</strong>, Brady’s celeb friends like <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong> and <strong>Will Ferrell</strong> and former Patriots teammates <strong>Rob Gronkowski</strong> and <strong>Julian Edelman</strong>.</p><p><a href=#><i>The Roast of Tom Brady</i></a> is available to stream now on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaappSnsrh50pyfrqSqYrewt8SsZJqan6rBbrDInZuyZZGjsW63xK%2Bgp2WYlr%2B1ecCtZK2nnWKvs63DsmSrp5GowXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-tasia-alexis-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Tasia Alexis Dating Now</span></a>
