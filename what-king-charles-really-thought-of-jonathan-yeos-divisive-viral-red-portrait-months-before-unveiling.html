We got the lowdown on some of the hilarious reactions that entertained the world – and his two daughters, and what the King really thought of it.</p><p><b><i>LISTEN: Jonathan Yeo reveals the biggest challenge he faced when painting King Charles</i></b></p><p id=et6jSkPZTLb data-wc=50>In the new episode, which you can listen to below, Jonathan opens up about his four-hour-long sittings with the King, some of which happened before he ascended to the throne. Also, how the Monarch reacted to his use of colour red in their last sitting, which took place last November.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7e23a70e5c0d-2x6d5eb.jpg><p id=eL62QGXUfIc data-wc=62>“When I showed it to him back in November, when it was sort of three-quarters done… certainly the face was done, body was sketched and the colour was mostly pretty much as it was, in the end. If he'd been appalled, I think, I might have rethought it and toned it down a bit. But he didn't seem that way,” Jonathan reveals.</p><p id=eEAFWACUIzP data-wc=34>Why the use of red? The painter explains:&nbsp;“That was something I'd made an early decision to try out. Because I thought it was an interesting colour and you want it to be interesting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2ac870346fe5-2x6d5yc.jpg><p id=e8Nj8YNhAg6 data-wc=31>Did he know the use of the colour would be so divisive? &nbsp;“I didn't think it was a risky thing to do, I thought it was an interesting colour,” he says.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">related</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="8 striking royal portraits of Princess Kate, Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Harry and more" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/bdec20f2acdc-royal-portraits.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="8 striking royal portraits of Princess Kate, Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Harry and more" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>8 striking royal portraits of Princess Kate, Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Harry and more</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="King Charles' 'contemporary' new portrait divides royal fans" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/706b8266e315-gettyimages-2152384109.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="King Charles' 'contemporary' new portrait divides royal fans" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>King Charles' 'contemporary' new portrait divides royal fans</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=evIQpZYCFgX data-wc=71>“It was a more formal commission than I'm used to," adds Jonathan of the high-profile job. The painter was given a specific size by The Drapers Company "because I had to match some other royal portraits they have in their hall". He was also told that Charles must be in uniform, "the Welsh Guard’s tunic with its bright red colour." So, his goal was "to figure out how to incorporate that."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ea08e0085e67-2x6d4xy.jpg><p id=e6LOMX_qoMD data-wc=37>In his chat with Andrea and Emily, Jonathan also reveals if the monarch made contact with him after the picture went viral, as well as detailing which were the most difficult parts of the artwork to paint.</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">LOVE THE ROYALS?
