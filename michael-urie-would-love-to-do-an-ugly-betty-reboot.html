We all keep in touch a little bit and some of us keep in touch a lot. I was texting with <a href=#><strong>Becki Newton</strong></a> today.

Can’t believe it!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>And the heartfelt message didn’t go unnoticed. “Well that’s my life made,” Ferrera wrote after she reposted the clip. “I love these two with every fiber of my being. Met them when I was 21 and we have grown more in love every year!”</p><p>With reporting by Nicki Gostin</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSim5iWsq151KugnmWnpMKtsIylpq%2BdXam8brDOZpinZaWcubp5wZ6rrbFdp7Kju86tZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matthew-perry-revealed-with-stephen-colbert-chris-farleys-death-caused-him-to-put-a-hole-jennifer-anistons-dressing-room.html><span>←</span><span>Matthew Perry Revealed With Stephen Colbert The Celebrity Death That Caused Him To Put A Hole Throug</span></a>
