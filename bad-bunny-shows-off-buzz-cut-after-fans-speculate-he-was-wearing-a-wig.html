In the clip, his hair was buzzed to his scalp — much different from his <a href=#>previous tight curls</a> — and he teamed his new hairstyle with a manicured goatee. The “Titi Me Pregunto” artist topped the look off with a <a href=#>sheer, long sleeve T-shirt</a>, rectangular eyeglasses, one diamond stud earring, one hoop earring and a gold necklace.</p><p>Earlier this month, Bad Bunny teased his haircut in his music video “Monaco.” At the end of the <a href=# rel=noopener>YouTube</a> clip he rocked a shaved head, but later left fans confused when he was seen with curly hair underneath<a href=#> a baseball cap</a>. Social media users then speculated that the hair was a wig, and he was waiting to reveal his shaved head in public.</p><p>In addition to showing off his new hair, Bad Bunny also<a href=#> referenced his romance</a> with <strong><a href=#>Kendall Jenner</a></strong>&nbsp;in the SNL promo After introducing himself as the <a href=#>host and musical guest</a> for the Saturday, October 21, show, he and cast member <strong>Heidi Gardner</strong> participated in a quick skit.</p><p>“I’ve been meaning to ask you,” Gardener said, before getting distracted and swatting at an imaginary fly in the studio. “Oh my God, what is that?”</p><p>Bad Bunny then attempted to kill the fly, <a href=#>telling the actress</a>, “Be careful Heidi, those mosquitos.”</p><p>Garner, who looked very impressed, concluded the skit by smiling at the rapper.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bad-Bunny-Shows-Off-Buzz-Cut-After-Shaving-Head-755.jpg><p>“Be careful 😉,” the SNL account captioned the video. Fans were quick to relate the skit to a similar moment<a href=#> he shared with Jenner</a>, 27.</p><p>“He forgot the ‘mamiii,’” one fan quipped as another wrote, “Someone give the writers a raise.”</p><p>In August, Bad Bunny shared an Instagram Story video of himself attempting to reach out to a wild chipmunk. It also appeared as if he was with Jenner, who was heard — but not seen — in the clip.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Mami, be careful,” he said as the two tried to approach the chipmunk. Jenner’s voice in the background then asked if the animal could be carrying rabies. He replied, “[No], the mosquitoes.” Though the pair have never commented on their romance, Bad Bunny and Jenner <a href=#>were first linked</a> in February, when they met through mutual friends. They’ve since been seen kissing in public, enjoying concerts and basketball games together and more.</p><p>“Things are going really well for Kendall and Bad Bunny and she definitely sees long-term potential with him,” a source <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly</a> in May. “She feels like he’s the complete package and he treats her like a total gentleman.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5eupXnBrqWnsV2otbDD0mamn55dl8K7xoycrK1lkZvBpr6Mn5inq12ovaav1KWYrZ1dnbJuw8CsZLCdkae2r7OMmmSwoZdk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./are-woody-and-jessie-toy-story-related-html.html><span>←</span><span>Are Woody and Jessie From 'Toy Story' Related?</span></a>
