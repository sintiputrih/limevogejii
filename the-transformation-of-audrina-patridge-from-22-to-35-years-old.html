Only months after her gig with MTV wrapped, Audrina appeared on ABC's "Dancing With the Stars." She tore up some rugs with dance partner, Tony Dovolani.</p><p dir=ltr>Unfortunately, the duo finished in seventh place and was the sixth couple to be eliminated. Dovolani had nothing but lovely things to say about his dance partner. "Being paired up with Audrina was like a breath of fresh air," he said, per&nbsp;<a href=#>ABC News</a>. "We had a blast through the entire process. We left with a smile on our face."&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>But this wasn't all for Audrina. Even before she finished on "The Hills," Audrina appeared in "Into the Blue 2: The Reef" in 2009, according to her <a href=#>IMDb</a> credits. She had her own reality show on VH1 called, fittingly, "Audrina," but it ended after one season. She also appeared on several episodes of the TV series "Dream Maker" in 2011 and in 2013, she appeared in "Scary Movie V." Audrina has some boast-worthy credits but she also has had an eventful, if somewhat trying, time with relationships.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWhjaH90e9OhnGasopa7tLLOq6SarJmku267xWaYrpyinruiec%2Baq6uhlJyybrLRqKRmamJiwbB5km5ksp2Rp8Buu8udZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sophie-turner-reveals-her-least-favorite-fashion-look-pics.html><span>←</span><span>Sophie Turner Reveals Her Least Favorite Fashion Look: Pics</span></a>
