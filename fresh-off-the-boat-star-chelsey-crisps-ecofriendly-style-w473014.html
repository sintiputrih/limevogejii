Read on for more!</p><p><i>Us</i>: Who are your style icons?</p><p>CC: I love <b>Jennifer Aniston</b> because she’s always so beautifully put together. I love <b>Diane Kruger</b>. I guess they’re both a little on the conservative side, but I love that they wear clothing that leaves something to the imagination.</p><p><i>Us</i>: You are a huge advocate of cruelty-free clothing and have spoken out against wearing fur and leather. Where do you shop for ecofriendly buys?</p><p>CC: Rebecca Minkoff makes great vegan shoes. I also have some vegan boots that are from a company called Rocket Dog. I love vegan handbags from Urban Expressions. One of my favorite online sites is <b>Jessica Simpson</b>‘s. Not everything is vegan on there, but I love the way she does shoes. I’m 5-foot-3, so very short, and I think Jessica is too. She designs platforms that are functional and comfortable, so you get a lot of extra height without just killing your feet.</p><span class=caption></span><p><i>Us</i>: You love to travel, so you must have your carry-on packing list down to a science. What are some of your travel essentials for a beach vacation?</p><p>CC: I’m about to order a bikini from Marysia. They are so cute, and the company makes nontraditional and interesting cuts. There’s also a romper from Zimmerman that is adorable. I tend to take sundresses and sun hats from this great hat company, Yo Suzy. I’m very pale because I’m Irish so I pack a lot of hats, sunglasses, cover-ups and sunscreen — lots and lots of sunscreen.</p><p><i>Us</i>: What are some other beauty essentials that you love to take on trips?</p><p>CC: My two favorite brands that are animal-friendly are Urban Decay and Au Naturale. I order their lip glosses straight from the site — they have a really beautifully pigmented lip color selection.</p><p><i>Us</i>: What’s next on your places-to-visit wish list?</p><p>CC: Bali. I used to live in Singapore, and it’s this huge regret of mine that I did not go to Bali when I was over there. But my favorite place has always traditionally been Hawaii. It’s so beautiful. It’s a little bit of a long flight, but so worth it. I was told when I got there that the island has a soul. It’s kind of a cheesy thing, but it’s so true. There’s just an energy to the island. You know how it takes a couple of days into a vacation before you can really relax? That’s not the case in Hawaii. You get off the plane and it’s so beautiful and calming.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>Stylish by Us Weekly</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5u%2Fpr%2FHZqafnl2ptaZ5waiYrWWjqa6zecKhnKWrla56pL7IrKesZZWYvKe%2ByJ6lnaSpYsC1xcueZLBsZ2h9coCO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./741924-paula-jai-parker-movies.html><span>←</span><span>Paula Jai Parker's 3 Biggest Movies</span></a>
