She landed her first television role when she was only 12, playing Alice/Young Syd in the episode “Syd in Wonderland” of the TV series Providence. Following this role, she had small appearances on TV shows such as The Brothers Garcia and The Nightmare Room, and in 2002, she starred in the movie Children on Their Birthdays.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Raymonde didn’t get her big break until she landed the recurring role of Cynthia Sanders in the popular Fox sitcom Malcolm in the Middle, where she got to work with stars such as Frankie Muniz and Bryan Cranston. “I was hopelessly in love [with] Frankie Muniz at the time so when I got this part I figured the next logical step would be that we would get married,” <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Raymonde admitted in a throwback Instagram post</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>How Christopher Masterson Really Felt About Working With Bryan Cranston On Malcolm In The Middle</a></span></p><p>Raymonde’s first appearance in Malcolm in the Middle was in season 2, episode 12, titled “The Krelboyne Girl,” where she plays a new student who quickly takes a liking to Malcolm (played by Muniz). Throughout the second season, Cynthia and Malcolm become friends, although the pair maintain a will-they-won't-they relationship that almost culminates in a kiss later on in the season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After this, Raymond reprised her role as Cynthia in season 3, episode 14, "Cynthia's Back," and the second episode of season 4, titled "Humilithon." Despite only appearing in four episodes between 2000 and 2002, Raymonde’s role in Malcolm in the Middle became a fan favorite. There’s no doubt fans would love to see Raymond play Cynthia once again if a Malcolm in the Middle reunion were ever to happen.</p><h2 id=tania-raymonde-had-regular-roles-in-lost-and-other-popular-tv-shows>Tania Raymonde Had Regular Roles In Lost And Other Popular TV Shows</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar46635827.jpg><p>Following her four-episode run in Malcolm in the Middle, Tania Raymonde went on to make small appearances on popular shows such as That's So Raven and The Guardian, CSI: New York, Bones, and Law & Order: Criminal Intent. She also had a leading role in the short-lived sitcom The O'Keefes in 2003.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, one of Raymonde’s most iconic roles other than Cynthia in Malcolm in the Middle was in the popular J.J. Abrams series Lost. In 2006, the actress began playing the recurring role of Alex Rousseau after appearing for the first time in the show in season 2, episode 15, "Maternity Leave," as Ben Linus’ (Michael Emerson) adopted daughter. She then went on to appear in 20 more episodes of the show until her character’s heartbreaking death in 2010.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Former Cast And Crew Have Exposed Lost For Its Dark Secrets And Toxic Work Environment</a></span></p><p>To this day, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Raymonde looks fondly back to her Lost days</a>. “Lost was such a great conversation starter,” she told Yitzi Weiner for Authority Magazine (via Medium).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“All the characters had secrets, everyone was hiding something. It toyed with the idea I think we all ask ourselves sometimes — what would have happened if I missed that plane? What if I said no instead of yes? Would the whole scope of my life be different? Maybe there’s an alternate universe out there where we made different choices. Everything Everywhere All At Once explores that beautifully, Lost did it too. I’m into it.”</p><h2 id=tania-raymonde-has-appeared-in-many-popular-series-since-her-brief-cameo-in-the-big-bang-theory>Tania Raymonde Has Appeared In Many Popular Series Since Her Brief Cameo In The Big Bang Theory</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar50149647.jpg><p>After Lost, Tania Raymonde went on to appear in many popular TV series, including Chicago Fire, Hawai 5.0., and Switched At Birth.
