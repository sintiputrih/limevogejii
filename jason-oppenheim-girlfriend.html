Read on for all the information you need.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify><strong>Who is Marie-Lou? Jason Oppenheim’s Girlfriend</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Jason-Oppenheim-Girlfriend-1-1024x536.jpg><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Age:&nbsp;25</strong></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Job: Model</strong></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Instagram: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@marielounurk</a></strong></p><p style=text-align:justify>Germany’s Marie-Lou Nuerk is a model and a brand promoter. She lives in Paris but works in Germany and the United States.</p><p style=text-align:justify>In July 2022, Nuerk met Jason Oppenheim while on holiday in Mykonos, Greece. Jason and his twin brother Brett were on vacation at the time.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Jason said about how they met: “I liked that she hadn’t seen the show, so she didn’t know who I was or about my relationship with Chrishell.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>Marie-Lou and Jason’s first walk down the red carpet was at the opening of Netflix’s Day Shift in August 2022.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Before he started dating Marie-Lou, Jason dated Chrishell Stause, who worked with him and was also one of his co-stars. At the end of season 5, Jason told Chrishell that he didn’t want to have children, which was a deal-breaker for Chrishell.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Jason’s feelings have changed since he started dating someone new. He says, “Right now, I’m more interested in being a husband than a father. I like that Lou doesn’t make me feel like I have to have a child or even think about it. It makes things easy for us.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>Marie-Lou says in season 6 that she doesn’t want kids until she’s in her late 30s. This gives the couple a lot of time before they start a family.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify><strong>Are Jason Oppenheim And Marie-Lou Still Together?</strong></h2><p style=text-align:justify><strong>It looks like Jason and Marie-Lou’s relationship is going well.</strong></p><p style=text-align:justify>Brett and a few other friends joined them in Australia to ring in the new year.

Met my dad a couple months ago. Met my mom on Thanksgiving. I’ve just met her mom over FaceTime, but you know, many times. And her grandpa. So I kind of feel like I know her family at this point.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>Oppenheim also said that things have been “awesome” between them as they’ve explored the world together.</p><p style=text-align:justify>“I went from like fully single and not thinking that I was gonna be in a relationship for years to being like in a full head over heels, you know, living together relationship, like, at a snap of a finger,” he said.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Marie-Lou also often posts pictures of the couple on her Instagram account.</strong></p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Marie-Lou Nuerk (@marielounurk)</a></p><p><strong>Relationship status of some trending celebrities:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Who is Raoul Moats ex-girlfriend Samantha Stobbart?
