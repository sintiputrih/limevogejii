This champion, who we now know is Mai Whelan, not only strutted away with some serious bragging rights, but also pocketed a whopping $4.56 million — the largest single cash prize in reality television and game show history.</p><p>Now, let's talk about money! After taxes, what's the scoop on how much cash the Squid Game: The Challenge winner stuffs into her pockets? Stick around, because we have all the answers you're looking for.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How is the 'Squid Game: The Challenge' winner's prize taxed?</h2><p>For those unaware, <a href=#>Squid Game: The Challenge was filmed in the United Kingdom</a>, where prize winnings are exempt from taxes. But here's the twist — if the winner in any given season hails from another country, say the United States, they're not entirely off the hook.</p><p>As it turns out, the Land of the Free overlords cast their wide net over global income, including those massive game show winnings. So, even though the U.K. is giving them a tax pass, an American victor has to cough up a decent amount of their earnings. That means Mai, for the inaugural season of the reality competition show.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Turbo Tax</a>, snagging $1,000 in a drawing means you're a cash prize winner. Now, cash prizes aren't just confined to lucky draws — you could win cash prizes in a sweepstakes, a game show, or on a reality TV competition like Squid Game: The Challenge. So, whether you're making it rain or flaunting a lone dollar bill, you must include all prize earnings as income on your tax return.</p><p>The amount of tax the Squid Game: The Challenge winners pay depends on where they live and how much cash they take home. Turbo Tax noted that opting for a lump sum payout, especially for a substantial jackpot (like $4.56 million), could place them in the highest tax bracket, resulting in a minimum tax obligation of 37 percent owed to the IRS.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Squid Game: The Challenge's first winner didn't get her prize money right away.</h2><p>The first season of Squid Game: The Challenge filmed in early 2023. But, Mai shared with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Times</a> in December 2023, she still hadn't received her payment from Netflix. Luckily, according to a show source who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> spoke with, there is reportedly a payment plan in place for one month after the finale airs.</p><p>Chances are, that will be the case for any future seasons as well.</p><p>Watch Squid Game: The Challenge on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqL62tcNmnpqllWLBqbGMnJ%2BapJyau6ixjKmporKVYsGixMSs</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./speculation-ways-legends-z-a-could-affect-horizons-300782.html><span>←</span><span>Speculation: Ways Legends Z-A could affect Horizons? | Page 2</span></a>
