His ABC profile includes the following interesting tidbit about him:</p><p>“Jordan H. is a recreational dirt bike racer.”</p><p>Helman wishes to share life’s greatest pleasure with the lady of his dreams, and he hopes that either Recchia or Windey, who most recently starred on Season 26 of The Bachelor, will check off his list.</p><h2>Jordan Helman from The Bachelorette</h2><p>Jordan Helman, a 25-year-old bachelor from Tampa, FL, is joining the program with the “goal of finding a lady who wants to experience life’s greatest joys at his side,” according to his official ABC description. He has been racing dirt motorcycles since he was four years old and has been in several accidents. Despite the bruises and discomfort, he never gave up his sport and has never missed a chance to ride his bike on the tracks to this day. The motocross athlete’s Instagram is loaded with dirt racing photos.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Jordan-Helman-2-1.jpg alt="Jordan Helman" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The dog dad loves his family and friends and spends a lot of time with them. He is now seeking a partner after settling down professionally. That is why Jordan has joined The Bachelorette season 19 in search of an ideal match who is “mature, independent, interesting, and eager to have a huge family” since Jordan wants a “lot of kids.”&nbsp;Jordan’s favorite move requires his spouse to “enjoy the unpredictability and be ready to receive flowers on any odd day of the week.”</p><p>Despite the fact that he is from Florida and enjoys the state, he “hates Florida drivers.” Jordan’s favorite holiday is the Fourth of July. Jordan earned a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (Management Information Systems) from West Virginia University in 2009. He subsequently started working as a.NET Software Developer at Global Data Consultants in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. He moved on to PNC Financial Services after more than a year of experience, where he worked as a Software Engineer for a year and five months. Jordan then joined Simplexity in August 2012 as a Content Developer in Reston, VA, and after six months there, he joined BAM Technologies as a Software Developer, where he has remained since 2013.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Jordan-Helman-3.jpg alt="Jordan Helman" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Season 19 of The Bachelorette</h2><p>The first episode of the program will premiere on Monday, with Gabby Windey and Rachel Recchia reuniting after The Bachelor to pursue love.&nbsp;The attributes that the main women want in their spouses will be revealed in the first episode.
