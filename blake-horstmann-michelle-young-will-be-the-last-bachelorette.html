Ratings are going to plummet.”</p><p>Longtime Bachelor host <a href=#><strong>Chris Harrison</strong></a> came under fire in February for defending season 25 Bachelor&nbsp;contestant <a href=#><strong>Rachael Kirkconnell</strong></a> for her <a href=#>racially insensitive Instagram posts</a>. His defense of the Georgia native, 25, came during an <a href=#>interview with former Bachelorette</a> <a href=#><strong>Rachel Lindsay</strong></a>.</p><p>After the conversation <a href=#>sparked controversy</a>, Harrison, 49, shared that he would <a href=#>step down as host for the remainder of the season</a>, which featured the first Black Bachelor lead, <a href=#><strong>Matt James</strong></a>.</p><p>“This historic season of&nbsp;The Bachelor&nbsp;should not be marred or overshadowed by my mistakes or diminished by my actions,” the Perfect Letter author wrote in a statement shared via&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;on February 13. “To that end, I have consulted with Warner Bros. and ABC and will be stepping aside for a period of time and will not join for the&nbsp;After the Final Rose&nbsp;special. I am dedicated to getting educated on a more profound and productive level than ever before. I want to ensure our cast and crew members, to my friends, colleagues and our fans: this is not just a moment, but a commitment to much greater understanding that I will actively make every day.”</p><p>One month later, he announced&nbsp;that his temporary leave of absence would <a href=#>extend to upcoming seasons of the show</a>. In his place, former Bachelorettes <a href=#><strong>Tayshia Adams</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kaitlyn Bristowe</strong></a> would host <a href=#><strong>Katie Thurston</strong></a> and Young’s upcoming seasons.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Though Horstmann believes her season may bring the end of the franchise, Young is still <a href=#>excited for her chance to find love</a>.</p><p>“I really do think that this process works. When you can set down all these outside distractions and really dive in, I think you can learn a lot about somebody,” the teacher explained during the After the Final Rose special&nbsp;in March.</p><p>Not only is Young hopeful that she’ll meet her perfect match, she’s also <a href=#>looking forward to ushering in a new era for the series</a>. “They know that I’m going to push forward to make an impact in a positive way, and I think they’re kind of jumping on my train to do that with me,” Young said during a Good Morning America appearance last month.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmlmZuaeqm70ayrppmeo3qutcKhnKWklWLGsMHNoGSwoZyheqOxjK2fnmWclsC1ecGamqGdnKS%2FpsDTnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-mike-sneesby-must-do-to-succeed-at-nine.html><span>←</span><span>What Mike Sneesby must do to succeed at Nine</span></a>
