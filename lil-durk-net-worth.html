This hip hop artist has been active in the music industry since 2011, and has been working under the labels Def Jam, Coke Boys and OTF.</p><p>Has Lil Durk accumulated lots of money from his career? It has been estimated by authoritative sources that as of late-2017, his net worth is over $500,000, accumulated since he began in the music business just a few years ago.</p><h3>Lil Durk Net Worth $500,000</h3><p>The rapper was raised in the reputedly violent area of Englewood in Chicago South, where he belonged to the gang of Black Disciples.</p><p>At first, Lil Durk didn’t believe that hip hop could be a profitable career, as although he was interested in this culture he didn’t take it very seriously. However, he proceeded to release several singles, including “Ima Hitta” (2011) and “Sneak Dissin” (2011), and only after those were successful and received positive critics’ reviews, did Lil Durk decide to pursue the career of a rapper full-time. Subsequently he released several mixtapes, including “I’m A Hitta” (2011), “I’m Still A Hitta” (2012), “Life Ain’t No Joke” (2012) and “Signed To The Streets” (2013) from which eight songs were released as music videos, too. In addition, his “Signed To The Streets” (2013) mixtape has been named the eighth best mixtape by the authoritative magazine Rolling Stone, which focuses on popular culture. More, he has released several singles, including “L’s Anthem” (2012), “Dis Ain’t What U Want” (2012), “I’m A Star” (2014) featuring <a href=#>French Montana,</a> and “Like Me” (2015) featuring <a href=#>Jeremih</a>. However, so far none of his singles has managed to appear on the music charts, nor received certificates for number of copies sold.</p><p>However, it’s important to mention the fact that Lil Durk has made frequent guest appearances with many artists, such as <a href=#>Lil Reese</a>, Fredo Santana, King Louie, <a href=#>Chief Keef</a>, <a href=#>Juelz Santana</a>, <a href=#>Jim Jones</a>, Chaz Gotti, <a href=#>Trae tha Truth</a> and Young Chop. In 2015, Lil has released his first, and so far only studio album entitled “Remember My Name” – unfortunately, the moment was lost as Durk’s manager Uchenna Agina (known by his nick name Chino) was killed a few days later, shot while in a car , and although friends took him to hospital, it was too late; his manager was only 24 years old.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lil Durk’s career does not obscure old habits that were formed in his adolescence. Lil was sentenced to spend three months in jail for illegal weapons possession in 2011, coinciding with the time when his girlfriend was pregnant. He later reportedly again experienced problems concerning weapons possession, however, this time he found a witness who admitted that the gun belonged to him, so although Durk was arrested the court released him after a few months. Regardless, these troubles with law enforcement agencies haven’t helped him to make progress in his career.</p><p>In his not-so-private life, Lil Durk is in a long term relationship with Nicole Covone, who is the mother of their three children: Bella Banks, Zayden Banks, Angelo Banks. Currently the family is residing in Los Angeles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjsLC5jqWgpWWUqr%2Bsec2eq2avn6fBqXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alex-jones-delights-very-rare-photo-husband-charlie-major-family-celebration.html><span>←</span><span>Alex Jones delights with very rare photo of husband Charlie for family celebration</span></a>
