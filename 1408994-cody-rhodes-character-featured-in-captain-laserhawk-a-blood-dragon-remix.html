Given the trailer, it seems like it is a blend of the Fight Club movie and DC Comics’ Suicide Squad. There are a plethora of characters who are trapped in a prison. Everyone needs to fight in order to survive. At the same time, they cannot escape because they have a bomb implanted in their heads.</p><p>In the trailer, we can see a character that resembles The American Nightmare Cody Rhodes, who vows to escape the prison. However, his escape does not go according to plan.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-jade-cargill-confirms-cody-rhodes-played-a-part-in-her-signing-with-wwe>Jade Cargill confirms Cody Rhodes played a part in her signing with WWE</h2><p>One of the biggest news that broke out earlier this week was WWE’s <a href=#>latest acquisition</a>.

I seen what the business did for him. I seen him just being the stellar athlete that he is. And I didn’t see any different for myself. But he was one of the guys that, you know, helped make this a great decision,” Jade Cargill said.</p><p>Recently, The American Nightmare hinted at wanting to go after the top championship in WWE as well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNpb3JxZGKwsLDYZqmhp5SawG6vx5qpmpukmr9ussSaq66qlZl6qrqMnJiprJGeu264wKycq6CRrLhurYybo6inlGKxs63GqKVmqpWitrk%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-are-gate-marks-on-cast-iron-html.html><span>←</span><span>What are gate marks on cast iron?</span></a>
