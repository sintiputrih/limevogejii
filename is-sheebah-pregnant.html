People are chatting and guessing since there’s a video of her wearing a long dress that appears to reveal a little of a belly.</strong></p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by BigEyeUG (@bigeyeug)</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Sheebah, once a TNS singer, is 35 years old. She has previously stated that she does not intend to marry since she finds males perplexing, but she like children and aspires to be a mother.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Fans are perplexed since Sheebah has stated unequivocally that she does not want to be in a relationship with a male, but there is speculation that she may be pregnant. This type of situation has already occurred in the music industry, where unexpected pregnancies have surprised everyone.</p><p style=text-align:justify>It’s critical to understand that unless Sheebah herself confirms her pregnancy, all speculation is futile. People want to know more, but it’s critical to respect Sheebah’s privacy and wait for her to respond officially.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Exploring the Flourishing Career of Sheebah Karungi!!</h2><p style=text-align:justify>With the Washington-produced song “Kunyenyenza,” Sheebah Karungi started singing on her own in 2010.
