When killed, ocelots only drop experience orbs, which give you a total of 1-3 experience points. However, ocelots will attack and kill chickens, so killing them could be worthwhile if your chickens are near a jungle farm.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Was Manny Pacquiao in his prime against Mayweather?</h2><time>Feb 12, 2024</time>
