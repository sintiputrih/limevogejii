Recommended Videos After premiering his new track Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay at theG.O.O.D. Music Showcase, Big Sean has officially released the track. Featuring fellow G.O.O.D. music member&nbsp;Kanye West and Roscoe Dash, the track is a great listen and has me hooked. The song will be on Big Sean’s upcoming debut album Finally Famous, which drops June 28th.
While many were questioning combining Kanye West (arguably the album’s biggest feature), with an artist like Roscoe Dash, I think it worked out pretty well.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Corsair Reveals Elgato 4K60 S+ Capture Box w/ SD Card &amp;amp; HEVC</h2><time>Jun 14, 2024</time>
