However, Nate eventually finds himself struggling with his newfound confidence and rise to prominence, ultimately finding himself at odds with his mentor.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=306 data-injectable=false>Nate’s arc throughout the Ted Lasso series is perhaps one of the more complex matters to unpack – and it takes a heck of an actor to whip our impression of their character back and forth from love, to hate, and everywhere in between.
