They had such an immediate and intense connection that Crawley decided to quit the show after just four episodes. Moss proposed to her after less than two weeks of filming, and <a href=#><strong>Tayshia Adams</strong></a> replaced her as the new Bachelorette.</p><p>When they returned to the real world, speculation about their relationship status immediately began. “Dale and Clare are technically still together but there are serious issues they are working through,” a source told Us Weekly in January. “They’re in communication but on a break.”</p><p>Shortly thereafter, Us confirmed that <a href=#>the duo had called it quits</a>. “I wanted [to] share with you all that Clare and I have decided to go our separate ways,” <a href=#>Moss wrote in a statement via Instagram</a>. “We appreciate the love and support we’ve received from so many people, but this is the healthiest decision for both of us at this time.”</p><p>The split didn’t stick for long, though, because by February, the twosome were <a href=#>spotted holding hands in Florida</a> and Us confirmed that <a href=#>they had decided to give their romance another a shot</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Dale has been pretty secretive with friends when they’re asking if he’s back with Clare, but it’s obvious to everyone that they’re back together,” an insider told Us at the time. “They’re just figuring things out and enjoying spending time together.”</p><p>The hairstylist <a href=#>popped up in one of Moss’ Instagram Stories</a> in April, but both continued to play coy about whether or not they were still engaged. Her ring, however, <a href=#>has made a couple of appearances on Instagram</a>.</p><p>“Clare has been wearing her engagement ring but she’s not ready to make a big announcement about her engagement being back on,” <a href=#>a source explained to Us last month</a>. “They aren’t rushing into marriage. They both are focused on work projects and want to make sure they’re in a good place career-wise before they can make a serious commitment.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadmZyaeq670qxkqaejqcBussirqq1loJ28tbuMsKCtoF2YuaK%2BxGaaq5mnobK6edKipZydXaeytrrIqKVo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./andrew-humphrey-2.html><span>←</span><span>Andrew Humphrey</span></a>
