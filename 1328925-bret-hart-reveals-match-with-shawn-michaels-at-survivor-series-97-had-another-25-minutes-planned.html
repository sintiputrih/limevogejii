Hart believes it was going to be a very special match.</p><p>“Even when we didn’t get along, Shawn and I always had great chemistry together in the ring,” Bret Hart said. “When we worked together, we wanted to be flawless, and we didn’t get along, and that added to the intensity. When I clothesline Shawn over the top rope and we brawl and fight outside the ring, I could tell it was going to be a really special match. It was very competitive. That match was just starting. All the brawling was done just to set up the actual match. It was going to really get going after I reversed his sharpshooter. We pictured the crowd standing up and going crazy. That was going to be the moment when it took off.”</p><p>What do you make of Bret Hart’s comments? Are you disappointed we never got to see the match he and Michaels originally envisioned?
