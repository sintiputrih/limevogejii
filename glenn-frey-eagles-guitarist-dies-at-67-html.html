According to a statement from the group, Frey died of&nbsp;complications from rheumatoid arthritis, acute ulcerative colitis, and pneumonia. Frey got his start as a musician in Detroit in the 1960s alongside Bob Seger and Jackson Browne, and one of his earliest recordings came as a session guitarist on Seger’s <a href=#>“Ramblin’ Gamblin’ Man.”</a>&nbsp;Frey moved to Los Angeles in 1969, where he became part of <a href=#>the Laurel Canyon music scene</a>. His first band was a short-lived folk duo called Longbranch Pennywhistle with J.D. Souther, who was dating Linda Ronstadt. The connection got Frey a job playing in&nbsp;Ronstadt’s backing band, where he met his future bandmates&nbsp;Don Henley, Randy Meisner, and Bernie Leadon. After Frey and Henley finished touring with Ronstadt, the four men decided to form their own band, which quickly became<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=#>the best band in the world</a>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-732151e96f27814f340e554a85c57357-3-0-0@published data-word-count=146>As an Eagle, Frey wrote and sang lead on many of the band’s greatest hits, including <a href=#>“Take It Easy”</a> (written with Browne), <a href=#>“Tequila Sunrise”</a> (written with Henley), and <a href=#>“Heartache Tonight”</a> (written with Henley, Seger, and Souther). The band was formed in the style of Crosby, Stills, and Nash — as Frey recalled to <a href=#><i>Vanity Fair</i></a>, “I watched them carefully — what they did right and what they did wrong” — but their careerist ambitions earned disdain from <a href=#>critics</a> and peers alike. (In the case of the latter, this was mixed with a healthy amount of jealousy.) It didn’t matter: The band was a commercial juggernaut, with five No. 1 singles, a greatest-hits album that is the second-best-selling album of all time in the U.S., and six Grammys over the course of their career. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-732151e96f27814f340e554a85c57357-4-0-0@published data-word-count=76>After the band’s breakup in 1980, Frey went solo, earning two top-5 hits with <a href=#>“The Heat Is On”</a> and <a href=#>“You Belong to the City.”</a> The latter was on the soundtrack to <i>Miami Vice</i>, where Frey had a memorable guest role as <a href=#>a lovable smuggler</a>. Frey reunited with the Eagles in 1994, releasing the album <i>Hell Freezes Over</i>, inspired by one of his and Henley’s dark jokes. He is survived by his wife, Cindy, and three children.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Glenn Frey, Eagles Guitarist, Dies at 67</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlob2dgZnyouMSnpWaeoprGbrHAoKOeq12cwqrAwKugrKxdmbamv4yaq2ZuZ2O1tbnL</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dashing-through-the-snow-2023-release-date-and-cast-everything-we-know.html><span>←</span><span>Dashing Through The Snow 2023 Release Date And Cast Everything We Know</span></a>
