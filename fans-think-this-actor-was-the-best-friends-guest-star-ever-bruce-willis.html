Plenty of huge names appeared on the show, and some fans have anointed one actor as the best of the bunch. We have all the details below!</p><h2 id=39-friends-39-is-an-iconic-show>'Friends' Is An Iconic Show</h2><p>NBC during the 1990s was stacked with popular shows, and as if having Seinfeld wasn't amazing enough, the network had the added bonus of Friends being another colossal hit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Debuting in 1994 with a set of performers ready to become household names, Friends was able to catch on with mainstream audiences in the blink of an eye. The show's format and premise had been done before, but the folks behind the scenes found the right ingredients to unleash a juggernaut of a sitcom.</p><p>From start to finish, Friends was a powerhouse of television. Its stars capitalized on opportunities away from the beloved sitcom, and once the dust had settled from its legendary run, it was consigned among the best shows ever made.</p><p>Friends hasn't had a new episode in ages, but thanks to streaming services and its relatable themes, the sitcom continues to live on as one of the most popular shows on the small screen. This has set an impossibly high bar for other shows.</p><p>Friends did so many things right while on the air, including roping in a number of high-profile guest stars that helped the show attract more viewers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston Revealed How She Really Dealt With The End Of 'Friends'</a></span></p><h2 id=friends-had-several-memorable-guest-stars>Friends Had Several Memorable Guest Stars</h2><p>Seeing major names as guest stars on a popular show is nothing new. While it was on the air, Friends was pulling down huge names left and right. Whether the guests were there for one episode or for eight, they all had a hand in shaping the show's legacy.</p><p>Reese Witherspoon is a great example of a major guest star on the show. She played Rachel Green's younger sister, and she was excellent in the role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reflecting on her time appearing on Friends</a>, Witherspoon said, "[Jennifer] was so sweet to me. I was really nervous, and she was like, ‘Oh, my gosh, don’t worry about it!’ I marvelled at her ability to perform in front of a live audience like that with no nerves. They would change all the lines and she was just so effortlessly affable, bubbly, and sunny. We’ve been friends ever since."</p><p>Witherspoon is easily one of the biggest and best guest stars in the show's history, but some fans have picked another performer as their all-time favorite guest star.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Where Is The Actual Apartment Building 'Friends' Shot The Outside Of?</a></span></p><h2 id=fans-think-bruce-willis-is-tops>Fans Think Bruce Willis Is Tops</h2><p>So, which guest star do fans think is the best in the show's history? While there were many great names to choose from, it sure seems like Bruce Willis is the answer for many.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For the unfamiliar, Willis played Paul Stevens on the show. Paul was Elizabeth's father, and he was not overly fond of the relationship that she had with Ross. Then again, most parents would disapprove of their child dating their professor.</p><p>Though it was only for three episodes, Willis left a lasting impression on the show and its loyal fans.</p><p>After a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit user chose Willis</a> as their favorite, some replied and pointed out something that confused them about Willis' appearance on the show.</p><p>"One thing that always bothered me about Bruce Willis being cast. There's at least one scene where Die Hard is referenced (the episode escapes me at the moment, but I'm sure they mentioned Die Hard), and I'm sort of confused as to how that's possible," the user wrote.</p><p>Of course, Willis wasn't the only notable guest star to come up during this particular discussion. Another fan listed out some other solid contenders.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Adam Goldberg is most memorable for me. Aisha Tyler was the most real. Giovanni Ribisi for multi-season guests, followed by Tom Selleck. For big, big names, I thought Charlie Sheen, Julia Roberts, and Gary Oldman did more than just show up, actually played characters," they wrote.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>After All These Years, 'Friends' Has Earned A Reputation For Being "The Worst"</a></span></p><p>Bruce Willis stands out as possibly the best guest star in Friends history. It's all subjective, of course, but it's hard to argue that the man wasn't excellent on the show.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Fans Spotted Matt LeBlanc And David Schwimmer's Crush On Jennifer Aniston In This 1994 BTS Moment</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYsGptc2kZK2gmah6oq%2FTqKlmr5GoerW0xGaZnqukYrOztcSnm6xll6qytMCMrKuaql2aw6a%2BjJuprpuVYsSquMuiqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1020421-edge-and-christian-podcast-return.html><span>←</span><span>Edge And Christians Pod of Awesomeness Returns With New Home On Westwood One Podcast Networ</span></a>
