Along with Virgil and Horace, Ovid is frequently considered one of the greatest poets of Latin literature. His most well-known work is Metamorphoses, or “Transformations,” a collection of mythological stories about humans transforming into other objects.

He reigned for only nine years, but Henry V’s tenure as king was marked by England’s success in the Hundred Years’ War against France. He is the title character in Shakespeare’s play Henry V, which details his victory over the French at Agincourt. His short reign came to an end in 1422, when he died at the age of 35 following a serious illness, possibly dysentery or smallpox.</p><h2>1815: Napoleon Bonaparte Returns From Exile</h2><p>Napoleon Bonaparte returns to Paris from his eleven-month exile in Italy, marking the beginning of the “Hundred Days,” or the War of the Seventh Coalition.

Within just three months, more than 300,000 copies had been sold. The book greatly influenced much of America’s views on slavery, and Abraham Lincoln reportedly said to Stowe in 1862, “So this is the little lady who made this big war.” Today, the novel remains one of the most noteworthy texts in American history.</p><h2>1928: Fred Rogers Is Born</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-407583 alt="Mister Rogers" width=800 height=869 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/mister-rogers.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-407583 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Family Communications Inc./Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Fred Rogers posing with a trolley from his beloved children’s show Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood in 1980.</span></p><p>Fred McFeely Rogers, better known simply as <a href=# rel=noopener>Mister Rogers</a>, is born in Latrobe, Pennsylvania.
