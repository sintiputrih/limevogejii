However, it's not due to a lack of interest. "I've met with every A&R, VP of A&R, president of the labels, CEOs," he told&nbsp;Fader&nbsp;in 2015 (via <a href=#>Insider</a>).&nbsp;"I know all these people." Basically, Chance has&nbsp;had the necessary connections —&nbsp;he's simply chosen not to use them.</p><p>Luckily, some execs have supported the singer-songwriter in his unlikely route to success: "They're almost like, 'Keep going. You're in uncharted territory, and you're helping to shed light on what [the future of the business] will look like, and we're all curious.'" But others have unfortunately been less kind.&nbsp;Chance later shared the downsides of going against the grain while speaking with&nbsp;<a href=#>Complex</a>, alleging that certain labels have tried to stump his growth by doing things like "push [him] out of headline positions so that their artist could be a headliner or not cleared songs."</p><p>"It's not like a big conspiracy theory," Chance assured, noting that some record label execs are upset because they "wanted to make money off me and I said no," while others don't like that he's admittedly advised friends from signing with certain people. "When they hear that back, then they tell other people bad s**t about me." Yikes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmam5jZoZ1e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5wqGYp5uVYsGpsYyrmKmolad8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./scott-fankhouser.html><span>←</span><span>Scott Fankhouser</span></a>
