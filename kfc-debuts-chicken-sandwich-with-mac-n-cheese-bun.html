The fast-food chain announced on Wednesday, February 13, that it now sells something called the Mac ‘N Cheese Zinger. As KFC aficionados might know, Zingers are the restaurant’s spicy fillet sandwiches, which are known for being a bit over-the-top.</p><p>While a Mac ‘N Cheese Zinger sounds like a sandwich that’s simply topped with some of the beloved comfort food, it’s much more decadent than that. According to the Kentucky-based company, this <a href=#>monster of a meal</a> consists of “mac and cheese molded into cheesy patties then fried to crispy perfection.” Those patties, which serve as buns in this case, are then combined with the signature KFC Zinger fillet.</p><p>As if that wasn’t enough, the hearty sandwich is then topped with crispy turkey bacon, lettuce and KFC cheese sauce, because apparently one can never have too much of the gooey dairy product. As KFC puts it: “This is the ultimate indulgent burger – so delicious, nothing else matters.”</p><p>However, if you’re salivating at the mention of one of these food items, be forewarned that they’re only currently available at KFC Singapore for a limited time. To make matters worse, there’s no indication when, or even if, this sandwich will make and appearance in the United States.</p><p>With that in mind, many Twitter followers made it clear they would travel near and far to get there hands on one of these bad boys. Check out a few positive reactions to the newbie below:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>is there any 24/7 kfc I want that new mac n cheese zinger</p><p>— khah lay see (@ebeneezera) <a href=#>February 13, 2019</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>wa i also want zinger mac n cheese</p><p>— 𝕢🍒 (@quraisyaismail) <a href=#>February 14, 2019</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>mac n cheese zinger im coming for uuuuu</p><p>— Poji (@VauzyVengeance) <a href=#>February 13, 2019</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The new KFC mac’n’ cheese zinger is tempting 🤔</p><p>— phad. (@fdhljs) <a href=#>February 13, 2019</a></p><p>However, not everyone was on board with this elaborate food offering. As one naysayer put it: “Please don’t ever buy the mac n cheese zinger burger unless you want to know how cholesterol tastes like on a bun.”</p><p>Another Twitter user, who has apparently tasted this latest Zinger, called the meal a flop, adding. “100/100 will NOT recommend!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Tell Us: Would you try KFC Singapore’s Mac ‘N Cheese Zinger?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqSek2Kxpq7Urapmm5iesKyxzWaqmqaUrLaktIywoK2gXaKupHnNZpqhnZWosm6u1Kdm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./j-j-russell-the-promising-journey-of-a-rising-star-linebacker.html><span>←</span><span>J.J.
