The Game of Thrones actress participated in Elle UK’s “It’s a Mood” video series, in which she shared the story behind some of her most buzzed-about outfits of all time.
During the 6-minute clip, published on March 4, 2020, Turner revealed the story behind her least favorite look, well, ever: the red Louis Vuitton blazer dress she wore to costars Kit Harrington and Rose Leslie’s wedding in 2018."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
