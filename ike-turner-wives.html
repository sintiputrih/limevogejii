He is a legendary musician, a pioneer of r</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Music enthusiasts are likely familiar with the name Ike Turner. As a rock & roll innovator and iconic guitarist, he has impacted countless other musicians over the years.</p><p>His turbulent and violent relationships with his wives, particularly with Tina Turner, have further marred his legacy.</p><p>We will explore Ike Turner’s complicated relationships, his several wives, and the legal disputes surrounding his fortune in this piece.</p><h3>The Rise of Ike Turner</h3><p>On November 5, 1931, Ike Turner was born in Clarksdale, Mississippi. At the age of eight, he started performing after displaying an early interest in music. He started a group called the Kings of Rhythm in the 1950s, and they made the song “Rocket 88,” which many people believe to be the first rock and roll tune. Turner’s career was sparked by the song’s success, and he quickly rose to fame in the music business.</p><h3>The Marriage of Ike and Tina Turner</h3><p>Ike’s band hired a teenage lady named Anna Mae Bullock as a backing singer in 1960. Ike and Anna Mae started dating after a series of incidents, which resulted in their marriage in 1962.</p><p>After renaming Anna Mae Tina Turner, the couple started performing as Ike & Tina Turner.</p><p>Their musical collaborations were a huge success, and they released <a href=#>songs</a> like “Proud Mary” and “River Deep, Mountain High.”</p><p>Their interpersonal relationship, however, was turbulent and aggressive. Later, Tina admitted that Ike had physically mistreated her all through their marriage, including when she was expecting. Both their marriage and their artistic collaboration came to an end when Tina decided she’d had enough and left Ike in 1978.</p><h3>Ike’s Other Marriages</h3><p>Ike claimed to have been married numerous times throughout his life in addition to Tina Turner. Although this number has not been verified, he claimed to have been married 14 times.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ub8c5ebd8fe7cc308f842121420eb0254><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Ike Turner : How Much Is Tina Turner's Ex-Husband Worth?</span></a><p>Prior to marrying Tina, he was previously married to Margaret Ann Thomas and Lorraine Taylor. He wed Audrey Madison Turner and Jeanette Bazzell following their divorce.</p><p>Although he has been married before, his marriage to Tina is still the most notorious.</p><h3>Legal Battles Over Ike’s Estate</h3><p>Ike Turner’s estate was worth $500,000 when he went away in 2007. Even though it may not seem like much, his heirs engaged in a court dispute over it.</p><p>Ike’s lack of a valid will at the time of his passing, as was previously indicated, resulted in a disagreement between his children, his ex-wife Audrey Madison Turner, and his lifelong friend James Clayton.</p><p>Ike gave Audrey Madison Turner a handwritten will that bequeathed everything to her, so at first she thought she was entitled to his inheritance.</p><p>James Clayton, however, came forward with a will that he asserted he had assisted Ike in writing and that also left everything to him.</p><p>In the end, Superior Court Judge Richard Cline determined that Audrey Madison Turner’s will was invalid but Clayton’s will was legitimate.</p><p>However, a later will that overruled both Clayton’s and Audrey Madison Turner’s claims rendered even Clayton’s will invalid. So, Ike’s children, who are his natural heirs, will receive the entirety of his inheritance.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Ike Turner’s marriages to his women are characterised by abuse, violence, and heartache. Even if his music was groundbreaking at the time, his personal difficulties have dominated his reputation.</p><p>The court struggle over his estate serves as a reminder of the difficulties in maintaining good relations within the family and the significance of leaving a proper will. The history of Ike Turner’s relationships with his wives is a sobering lesson and a harsh warning that even the most talented musicians may have a nasty side.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt="how many wives did ike turner have,how many children did ike turner have,tina turner spouse,ike turner net worth,tina turner net worth,tina turner children,ike turner funeral,ike turner cause of death,ike turner wife,ike turner wife lorraine,ann thomas ike turner wife,ike turner first wife lorraine taylor,ike turner ex wife lorraine,ike turner 13 wives,ike turner how many wives,ike turner ex wife,ike turner first wife lorraine,who were ike turner's wives,ike turner wifebeater" itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
