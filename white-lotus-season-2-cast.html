Who is part of the Season 2 cast?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO Max</span></figure><p>We could not be more ready to check into the <a href=#>White Lotus</a> hotel again in <a href=#>Sicily</a>, where Season 2 of the popular show is headed. The location may be different, but we're definitely going to see at least one familiar guest for the second season. Will we also witness a grown man defecating into a suitcase? More will be revealed. For now, let's check out who will be a part of the Season 2 cast of White Lotus.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who's in the cast of 'White Lotus' Season 2?</h2><p>The first season of HBO Max's White Lotus dropped in July 2021, during that very brief time when vaccinations were being rolled out before COVID-19 variants began taking their toll. It was a sweet spot of sorts, which means a series that centered around a group of people vacationing at a beautiful resort in Hawaii was a welcome sight. The show felt like a spiritual sequel to the movie Clue and even had a butler, in the form of a hotel concierge, with a drug problem. It was perfect.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO Max</span></figure><p>Before Season 2 was confirmed, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">EW</a> spoke with creator, writer, and director Mike White about the plight of the second season. "In TV, it's hard to start from scratch and go through the whole thing again ... I would do another season because I feel like there's a way to get at some new themes and do it in a way that feels fresh from this one."</p><p>No need to reinvent the wheel entirely because we're getting at least one former guest in Season 2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> reported <a href=#>Jennifer Coolidge</a> is reprising her role as the sweetly self-deprecating Tanya McQuoid. As of the time of this writing, she's the only cast member from Season 1 coming back for Season 2. Jennifer's character was a fan favorite, which is no surprise as everything she touches turns to comedy gold.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>in this lifetime, I want a hug from Jennifer Coolidge</p>— chantel j. wambsgans (@imchanteldude) <a href=#>February 25, 2022</a></figure><p>She's joined by Season 2 newcomers <strong>F. Murray Abraham</strong> (The Grand Budapest Hotel), <strong>Adam DiMarco</strong> (<a href=#>The Order</a>), <strong>Meghann Fahy</strong> (The Bold Type), T<strong>om Hollander</strong> (The King's Man), <strong>Michael Imperioli</strong> (The Sopranos), <strong>Theo James</strong> (Dual), <strong>Aubrey Plaza</strong> (Parks and Recreation), <strong>Haley Lu Richardson</strong> (Five Feet Apart), <strong>Will Sharpe</strong> (Giri/Haji), and <strong>Leo Woodall</strong> (Cherry). We can't wait to see what trouble these guests get into. Hopefully, everyone checks in and checks out alive at the end of the season!</p><p>Of course, the standout character from Season 1, in terms of bodily functions, was definitely Armond (played by Murray Bartlett). And while we can't guarantee the next hotel manager will be dealing with important fecal matters, we do know who's been cast as the resort manager of White Lotus: Sicily. <strong>Sabrina Impacciatore</strong>, an Italian actress and comic, will be taking care of the guests in Season 2. Sabrina will be playing the part of Valentina, who hopefully will not handle suitcases the same way Armond did.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Sabrina Impacciatore cast as Valentina in 'White Lotus' Season 2</p></figure><p>As of now, Sabrina's probably unknown to most American viewers, as she's almost exclusively appeared in Italian film and TV. That said, some may have seen her as Seraphia in The Passion of the Christ. Her upcoming film <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Across the River and Into the Trees</a> is currently in post-production, and stars Josh Hutcherson and Liev Schreiber. It's safe to say that Sabrina is going to become a much more recognized face!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWqwMRmo6ispah6tLHArKanZWJisKK%2F0w%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./damien-and-francesca-holding-hands.html><span>←</span><span> Damien and Francescas holding hands pic explored Love is Blind rumors circulate!
