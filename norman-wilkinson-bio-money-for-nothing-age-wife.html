While they assumed that he didn‚Äôt participate in the show, little did they know that he had passed away.</p><p>So, is Normal Wilkinson alive or dead? What happened to him? Does he have a wife? We address it all in this Norman Wilkinson Bio.</p><h3><strong>Is Money For Nothing Carpenter Norman Wilkinson Alive?</strong></h3><p>Yes, carpenter Norman Wilkinson is still alive. Although, several sources including ours previously claimed based on <a href=#>an obituary</a> that falsely claimed his death. It was a blunder as the obituary was for a different man with the same name. The son of the person who the obituary was about later corrected it stating, ‚ÄúHi. I‚Äôm sorry for any upset caused to those who think this is linked to the carpenter who used to appear on TV. This obituary is for my late father Norman Wilkinson. Not the same person.‚Äù</p><p>So, he is alive and well and thriving, and still making beautiful pieces of furniture.</p><h3><strong>Money For Nothing: What Happened To Norman Wilkinson?</strong></h3><p>Ever since the new episodes of 2019 debuted in Money For Nothing on BBC One, fans started asking questions about Norman‚Äôs whereabouts in the show. They only wondered why he was absent on the episodes of the show.</p><p>So, fans tweeted asking why he was missing from the show. One Twitter user named @ValerieWatters7 tweeted ‚ÄúLovely Rug. Where are Norman these days.‚Äù Similarly, another user @pcalvey77 asked, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Norman this series?‚Äù</p><p>Little did they know that Norman had passed away in 2019. However, the reason behind the cause of his death wasn‚Äôt revealed.</p><p>After fans discovered that Norman had passed away, fans went on Facebook to give their final goodbyes. Some of the condolences are,</p><p><strong>Susan Morris:</strong> Loved watching Norman and the wonderful work he did. So sad to learn that he has passed away god bless you Norman may you rip <span class=_5mfr><span class=_6qdm>üôè</span></span></p><p><strong>Thomas Rowell:</strong> Norman is a genius with wood-like all his word great bloke with a wicked sense of humor</p><p><strong>Nicolette Poulter:</strong> Love this man and his craftsmanship not to mention his sense of humor x</p><p><strong>Susan Morris:</strong> Loved Norman and his sexy voice so sad to hear he has passed away rest in peace dear Norman&nbsp;<span class=_5mfr><span class=_6qdm>üò¢</span></span></p><h3><strong>Norman Wilkinson Age</strong></h3><p>Reality Titbits reported that Norman Wilkinson was 78 years old and was born on 7 June 1940. However, he looked far younger to be in his 70s. More like, he was in his 50s.</p><h3><strong>Norman Wilkinson Wife</strong></h3><p>Norman Wilkinson might‚Äôve been married, however, he always kept his private life away from public eyes. He preferred to remain strictly professional and shared almost nothing regarding his life as a family man. Hence, we hold no information of his surviving wife and his kids, if he had left any in this world.</p><p>Furthermore, his lack of presence on social media made it even harder to unravel information on his personal life.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>How Tall Was Norman Wilkinson?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Norman, who appeared a little bit taller than the host of the show Sarah Moore (5 feet 7 inches), stood tall to the height not less than 5 feet 9 inches.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>How Much Was Norman Wilkinson Worth?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Norman built business his entire career as a woodworker/carpenter. Over the years, his work earned praises from the fans of the Money For Nothing. Some even claimed that he was the most creative and talented guy in the whole show.</p><p>His craftsmanship with woods always dazzled his fans making them want to see more of his work on the new episodes. Hence, when he went missing from the show, fans missed him and were asking about him because they admired the work he had done in the show.</p><p>So, we could conclude that he was an exceptional carpenter by profession. Outside of the show, he had also done some charity workshops.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Was Norman Wilkinson Born?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Norman Wilkinson reportedly has his workshop in Hellingly, a village civil parish in the Wealden District of East Sussex, in England. Though we don‚Äôt know where he was born, he most likely lived his adult life in Hellingly.</p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmp6eioq6vedaio6Shnqi8r3nBoqZmpZ%2Bjsrp5xaipZqafqbWqusZmmKCdXay2p7GO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-apple-iphone-15-pro-max-cases.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>The best iPhone 15 Pro Max cases in 2023: the 20 best ones</span></a>
