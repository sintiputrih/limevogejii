When the former stopped by our office, we just needed to ask him about how the track came about, especially considering the differences in their musical styles. After initially recording his portion of the song in his bedroom studio, Bexey hopped on a flight to Florida to link with JackBoy and Mikey The Magician, coming through with the final mixdown and completing a handful of other unreleased bangers.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Bexey knows how bizarre people find this collaboration to be, given the fact that they live on opposite sides of the world. However, the track came about organically. "When I first heard the beat, I don't know where I was but I remember JackBoy texted me and I put my headphones in and I was just like 'This shit is crazy!' He's a sick producer, Diablo. And the chorus is perfect, very catchy," he explained.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In his lyrics, Bexey discusses his fearless attitude toward life, not being afraid to die and approaching all situations without any worry.
