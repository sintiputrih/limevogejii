But, it always falls
I see you come, I see you go

Maybe one of the meanings of this song is a message of perseverance in the face of difficulties. The song is about not giving up, even when someone tells you that everything will eventually fall apart. The lyrics are a conversation between two people, in which one person tells the other that they have seen everything before and that all things eventually pass into the night. The other person disagrees, saying that they must keep going and not give up hope, no matter what.</p><br><p>Another interpretation of the lyrics is that the song is about transcending obstacles and limitations. The image of flying horses in the chorus seems to suggest a sense of freedom - as if the singer is rising above the struggles of everyday life. It's not clear what the flying horses represent or what their significance is, but the phrase "goodbye horses" seems to indicate letting go of something that was once important or meaningful. This may be an expression of the desire for change, or a commentary on the inevitability of change.</p><br><p>Overall, "Goodbye Horses" is a mysterious and enigmatic song that can be interpreted in many different ways. It is a haunting and melancholic tune that captures the spirit of perseverance and the desire for change in a uniquely poetic way.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>He told me, 'I see you rise'</u><br>He observed and acknowledged my successes</p><br><p><u>But, it always falls</u><br>But, they are always short-lived and followed by failure</p><br><p><u>I see you come, I see you go</u><br>I notice you moving in and out of my life</p><br><p><u>He say, 'All things pass into the night'</u><br>He believes that everything fades away eventually</p><br><p><u>And I say, 'Oh no sir I must say you're wrong</u><br>And I argue, 'No, I disagree with you'</p><br><p><u>I must disagree, oh no sir, I must say you're wrong'</u><br>I refuse to accept this view, and I want to make it clear</p><br><p><u>Won't you listen to me</u><br>Please hear me out</p><br><p><u>He told me, 'I've seen it all before'</u><br>He claimed that he had experienced everything previously</p><br><p><u>I've been there, I've seen my hopes and dreams, A lying on the ground</u><br>He had dreams and aspirations that didn't work out</p><br><p><u>I've seen the sky just begin to fall</u><br>He had witnessed a downfall or adversity</p><br><p><u>Goodbye horses I'm flying over you</u><br>Farewell horses, I am leaving above you</p><br><p><u>Goodbye horses I'm flying over you</u><br>Farewell horses, I am soaring over you</p><br><p><u>Goodbye horses I'm flying over you</u><br>Farewell horses, I am flying over you</p><br><p><u>Goodbye horses I'm flying, flying, flying, flying over you</u><br>Goodbye horses, I'm flying so much higher, way above you.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Universal Music Publishing Group<br>Written by: William Garvey</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maImPga67xsCrrKxnd6S8pa7YnpaBp6KosrSrh32cpqePZnY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-cuomo-net-worth-262467.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Cuomo Net Worth 2024</span></a>
