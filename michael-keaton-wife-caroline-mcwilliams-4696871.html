Although he dated&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;star&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Courtney Cox </strong></a>from 1990 to 1995, he hasn’t been publicly linked to anyone else in a serious relationship capacity since then. Here we take a look at his first and only marriage to Caroline and what you need to know about the actress he loved for eight years.</p><h2><strong><strong><strong>She’s Best Known For Her Role In ‘Guiding Light’&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Michael-Keaton-Wife-Caroline-McWilliams-ss-post11.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Like her then-husband, Caroline was an actor and got her start in television. Her career began on the well-known and long-running soap opera&nbsp;Guiding Light&nbsp;as Janet Mason Norris from 1969 to 1975. After she ended her run on the show, she also appeared in episodes of hit shows like&nbsp;Kojak,&nbsp;Barney Miller&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Incredible Hulk. Caroline also had a role in the sitcom&nbsp;Soap&nbsp;in 1978 and 1979, moving on to be in 49 episodes of&nbsp;Benson&nbsp;thereafter. She went on to appear in various TV pilots in the ’80s, ultimately finding a role on&nbsp;Nearly Departed&nbsp;which was a short-lived 1989 sitcom.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Caroline continued to act through the ’90s, finding roles in&nbsp;Beverly Hills, 90210&nbsp;and&nbsp;Home Improvement. In addition to starring in the 1990 movie&nbsp;Mermaids, Caroline’s last role was as Helene Steele in three episodes&nbsp;of <i>Judging Amy</i> in 2002 and 2003.</p><h2><strong><strong><strong>She & Michael Share A Son Together & They Remained Close&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Michael-Keaton-Wife-Caroline-McWilliams-ss-post21.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Although the former couple was only married about eight years, they share one son together, named&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sean Maxwell Douglas</strong></a>. Born May 27, 1983, Sean went on to become a songwriter and producer, winning awards and writing for various singers like&nbsp;<strong>Jessie J</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Demi Lovato</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Chris Brown</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Madonna</strong>, and more. He notably won a Grammy for his work on&nbsp;<strong>Lizzo</strong>‘s&nbsp;Cuz I Love You&nbsp;and co-wrote&nbsp;<strong>Thomas Rhett</strong>‘s song “Die a Happy Man” which won a slew of awards, including the CMA award for Single of the Year.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>In addition to being proud of their son, before her death, Michael and Caroline remained close even after their divorce, Michael told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ELLE&nbsp;magazine</a> in 2010. He noted his sister and brother also lost former spouses and told him it would be “harder than you think.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“And the feelings that came up were odd, but not in a bad way, necessarily, because we had remained close,” he stated. “She was a remarkable mom. Sean is the great guy he is because of her—we’ve always been tight, but now the bond’s even tighter. We’re the family now.”</p><h2><strong><strong><strong>She Died Of Multiple Myeloma&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>In February 2010, Caroline’s family told the Los Angeles&nbsp;Times&nbsp;that she had died from complications of multiple myeloma, which, according to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>American Cancer Society</a>, is a cancer that comes from malignant plasma cells. While normal cells are in bone marrow and the immune system needs them, when they grow out of control, they “produce a tumor called plasmacytoma.” When an individual has one single plasma cell tumor, it’s called an isolated plasmacytoma, but when they have more than one, it’s multiple myeloma.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Caroline was survived by of course Michael and their son Sean as well as her sisters Kelly-Jo Dvareckas, Norma Liedtke and Patti McWilliams.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8yimqGZlaF6rLHAraanZaees6Z5wpqpqKSZo7JuucKwoKWkmZa6tHmTb3BvcGdmfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-i-downclock-my-powerful-gpu.html><span>←</span><span>Why I downclock my powerful GPU, and you should too</span></a>
